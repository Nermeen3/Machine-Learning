ITEM 1.
BUSINESS 
  General Description of Business and Fiscal Year 2010 Developments
 Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the Company or Air Products), a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1940,
serves technology, energy, industrial, and healthcare customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, equipment, and services. The
Company is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and helium and has built leading positions in growth markets such as semiconductor materials, refinery hydrogen, natural gas liquefaction, and advanced coatings and adhesives. As used in this
report, unless the context indicates otherwise, the term “Company” includes subsidiaries and predecessors of the registrant and its subsidiaries.  On 11 February 2010, Air Products Distribution, Inc. (Purchaser), a wholly owned subsidiary of Air Products, commenced a cash tender offer for all the outstanding shares of common stock of Airgas, Inc.
(Airgas) not already owned by Air Products. Airgas is the largest U.S. distributor of packaged industrial, medical, and specialty gases, and associated hard goods such as welding equipment. The offer is scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City
time, on Friday, 3 December 2010, unless further extended.  The Company manages its operations, assesses
performance, and reports earnings under four business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy.  Financial Information about Segments  Financial information concerning the
Company’s four business segments appears in Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 herein. 
Narrative Description of Business by Segments 
Merchant Gases  Merchant Gases sells atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air); process gases such as hydrogen and helium (purchased or refined from crude
helium); and medical and specialty gases, along with certain services and equipment, throughout the world to customers in many industries, including those in metals, glass, chemical processing, food processing, healthcare, steel, general
manufacturing, and petroleum and natural gas industries.  Merchant Gases includes the following types of products:
 Liquid bulk—Product is delivered in bulk (in liquid or gaseous form) by tanker or tube trailer and stored,
usually in its liquid state, in equipment designed and installed by the Company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed. Liquid bulk sales are typically governed by three- to five-year contracts. 
Packaged gases—Small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars. The Company operates packaged
gas businesses in Europe, Asia, and Brazil. In the United States, the Company’s current packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging (principally helium) industries. 
Small on-site plants—Customers receive product through small on-sites (cryogenic or noncryogenic generators), either by
a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer.  Healthcare products—Customers receive
respiratory therapies, home medical equipment, and infusion services. These products and services are provided to patients in their homes, primarily in Europe. The Company has leading market positions in Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, and
in Mexico through its equity affiliate.  Electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric
gases—oxygen, nitrogen, and argon. Natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the Company’s Merchant Gases facilities. The Company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through pricing formulas and surcharges. A
shortage or interruption of electricity or natural gas supply, or a price increase that cannot be passed through to customers, possibly for competitive reasons, may adversely affect the operations or results of Merchant Gases. During fiscal year
2010, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials.  Merchant
Gases competes worldwide against three global industrial gas companies: L’Air Liquide S.A.; Linde AG; Praxair, Inc.; and several regional sellers (including Airgas, primarily with respect to liquid bulk sales). Competition in industrial gases
is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications.

Competition in the healthcare business involves price, quality, service, and reliability of supply. In Europe, primary healthcare competitors include the same three global industrial gas
companies mentioned previously, as well as smaller regional service providers. In some countries such as Spain and the United Kingdom, the Company tenders for significant parts of the healthcare business with government agencies and is expecting to
participate in tenders in some countries over the coming fiscal year.  Merchant Gases sales constituted 41% of the
Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2010, 44% in fiscal year 2009, and 40% in fiscal year 2008. Sales of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and argon) constituted approximately 20% of the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal
year 2010, 21% in fiscal year 2009, and 18% in fiscal year 2008.  Tonnage Gases 
Tonnage Gases provides hydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and syngas principally to the energy production and refining,
chemical, and metallurgical industries worldwide. Gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by contracts with
15- to 20-year terms. The Company is the world’s largest provider of hydrogen, which is used by oil refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels to reduce smog and
ozone depletion. The energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification. The metallurgical industry uses nitrogen for inerting and oxygen for the manufacture of steel and
certain nonferrous metals. The chemical industry uses hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and synthesis gas (a hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixture) as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals. The Company delivers product through
pipelines from centrally located facilities in or near the Texas Gulf Coast; Louisiana; Los Angeles, California; Alberta, Canada; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Southern England, U.K.; Northern England, U.K.; Western Belgium; Ulsan, Korea; Nanjing,
China; Tangshan, China; Kuan Yin, Taiwan; Singapore; and Camaçari, Brazil. The Company also owns less than controlling interests in pipelines located in Thailand and South Africa. 
Tonnage Gases also includes a Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI) business. At its Pasadena, Texas facility, the Company produces
dinitrotoluene (DNT), which is converted to toluene diamine (TDA) and sold for use as an intermediate in the manufacture of a major precursor of flexible polyurethane foam used in furniture cushioning, carpet underlay, bedding, and seating in
automobiles. Most of the Company’s TDA is sold under long-term contracts with raw material cost and currency pass-through to a small number of customers. The Company employs proprietary technology and scale of production to differentiate its
polyurethane intermediates from those of its competitors.  Natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen, carbon
monoxide, and synthesis gas production. Electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. The Company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through long-term cost pass-through contracts. Toluene,
ammonia, and hydrogen are the principal raw materials for the PUI business and are purchased from various suppliers under multiyear contracts. During fiscal year 2010, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of
energy or raw materials.  Tonnage Gases competes in the United States and Canada against three global industrial gas
companies: L’Air Liquide S.A.; Linde AG; Praxair, Inc.; and several regional competitors. Competition is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, the development of applications that use industrial gases, and, in some cases, provision
of other services or products such as power and steam generation. The Company also derives a competitive advantage from its pipeline networks, which enable it to provide a reliable and economic supply of products to customers. Similar competitive
situations exist in the European and Asian industrial gas markets where the Company competes against the three global companies as well as regional competitors. Global competitors for the PUI business are primarily BASF Corporation and Bayer AG.
 Tonnage Gases sales constituted approximately 32% of the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2010, 31% in
fiscal year 2009, and 34% in fiscal year 2008. Tonnage Gases hydrogen sales constituted approximately 15% of the Company’s consolidated sales in both fiscal year 2010 and 2009, and 17% in fiscal year 2008. 
Electronics and Performance Materials 
Electronics and Performance Materials employs applications technology to provide solutions to a broad range of global industries
through chemical synthesis, analytical technology, process engineering, and surface science. This segment provides the electronics industry with specialty gases (such as nitrogen trifluoride, silane, arsine, phosphine, white ammonia, silicon
tetrafluoride, carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoromethane, critical etch gases, and tungsten hexafluoride) as well as tonnage gases (primarily nitrogen), specialty chemicals, services, and equipment for the

manufacture of silicon and compound semiconductors, thin film transistor liquid crystal displays, and photovoltaic devices. These products are delivered through various supply chain methods,
including bulk delivery systems or distribution by pipelines such as those located in California’s Silicon Valley; Phoenix, Arizona; Tainan, Taiwan; Gumi and Giheung, Korea; and Tianjin and Shanghai, China. 
Electronics and Performance Materials also provides performance materials for a wide range of products, including coatings, inks,
adhesives, civil engineering, personal care, institutional and industrial cleaning, mining, oil refining, and polyurethanes, and focuses on the development of new materials aimed at providing unique functionality to emerging markets. Principal
performance materials include polyurethane catalysts and other additives for polyurethane foam, epoxy amine curing agents, and auxiliary products for epoxy systems, specialty surfactants for formulated systems, and functional additives for
industrial cleaning and mining industries.  The Electronics and Performance Materials segment uses a wide variety of raw
materials, including silane, amines, alcohols, epoxides, organic acids, and ketones. During fiscal year 2010, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials. 
The Electronics and Performance Materials segment faces competition on a product-by-product basis against competitors ranging from
niche suppliers with a single product to larger and more vertically integrated companies. Competition is principally conducted on the basis of price, quality, product performance, reliability of product supply, technical innovation, service, and
global infrastructure.  Total sales from Electronics and Performance Materials constituted approximately 21% of the
Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2010, 19% in fiscal year 2009, and 21% in fiscal year 2008. 
Equipment and Energy  Equipment and Energy designs and manufactures cryogenic equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas liquefaction (LNG), and helium distribution (cryogenic transportation
containers), and serves energy markets in a variety of ways.  Equipment is sold globally to customers in the chemical and
petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing industries. The segment also provides a broad range of plant design, engineering, procurement, and construction management services to its
customers.  Energy markets are served through the Company’s operation and partial ownership of cogeneration and flue
gas desulfurization facilities, its development of hydrogen as an energy carrier, and oxygen-based technologies to serve energy markets in the future. The Company owns and operates a cogeneration facility in Calvert City, Kentucky and a 49-megawatt
fluidized-bed coal and biomass-fired power generation facility in Stockton, California; and operates and owns a 47.9% interest in a 112-megawatt gas-fueled power generation facility in Thailand. The Company also operates and owns a 50% interest in a
flue gas desulfurization facility in Indiana.  Steel, aluminum, and capital equipment subcomponents (compressors, etc.)
are the principal raw materials in the equipment portion of this segment. Adequate raw materials for individual projects are acquired under firm purchase agreements. Coal, petroleum coke, and natural gas are the largest cost components in the
production of energy. The Company mitigates these cost components, in part, through long-term cost pass-through contracts. During fiscal year 2010, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials.
 Equipment and Energy competes with a great number of firms for all of its offerings except LNG heat exchangers, for
which there are fewer competitors due to the limited market size and proprietary technologies. Competition is based primarily on technological performance, service, technical know-how, price, and performance guarantees. 
The backlog of equipment orders (including letters of intent believed to be firm) from third-party customers (including equity
affiliates) was approximately $274 million on 30 September 2010, approximately 30% of which is for cryogenic equipment and 50% of which is for LNG heat exchangers, as compared with a total backlog of approximately $239 million on
30 September 2009. The Company expects that approximately $250 million of the backlog on 30 September 2010 will be completed during fiscal year 2011.

Narrative Description of the Company’s Business Generally 
The Company, through subsidiaries, affiliates, and minority-owned ventures, conducts business in over 40 countries outside the
United States. Its international businesses are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls; import and export controls; and other economic, political, and
regulatory policies of local governments.  The Company has majority or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in
Canada, 17 European countries (including the United Kingdom and Spain), nine Asian countries (including China, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan), and four Latin American countries (including Mexico and Brazil). The Company also owns
less-than-controlling interests in entities operating in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America (including Italy, Germany, China, India, Singapore, Thailand, South Africa, and Mexico). 
Financial information about the Company’s foreign operations and investments is included in Notes 8, Summarized Financial
Information of Equity Affiliates; 22, Income Taxes; and 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 herein. Information about foreign currency translation is included under
“Foreign Currency” in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and information on the Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations is included in Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, included under
Item 8 below, and in “Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk,” included under Item 7A below. Export sales from operations in the United States to unconsolidated customers amounted to $570.5 million, $510.2 million, and
$629.1 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Total export sales in fiscal year 2010 included $387.8 million in export sales to affiliated customers. The sales to affiliated customers were primarily equipment sales
within the Equipment and Energy segment and the Electronic and Performance Materials segment.  Technology Development
 The Company pursues a market-oriented approach to technology development through research and development,
engineering, and commercial development processes. It conducts research and development principally in its laboratories located in the United States (Trexlertown, Pennsylvania; Carlsbad, California; Milton, Wisconsin; and Phoenix, Arizona); the
United Kingdom (Basingstoke, London, and Carrington); Germany (Hamburg); the Netherlands (Utrecht); Spain (Barcelona); and Asia (Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China; Giheung, Korea; and Chubei, Taiwan). The Company also funds and cooperates in research
and development programs conducted by a number of major universities and undertakes research work funded by others—principally the United States government. 
The Company’s corporate research groups, which include science and process technology centers, support the research efforts of
various businesses throughout the Company. Technology development efforts for use within Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, and Equipment and Energy focus primarily on new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of
industrial gases and new or improved applications for all such products. Research and technology development for Electronics and Performance Materials supports development of new products and applications to strengthen and extend the Company’s
present positions. Work is also performed in Electronics and Performance Materials to lower processing costs and develop new processes for the new products.  Research and development expenditures were $114.7 million during fiscal year 2010, $116.3 million in fiscal year 2009, and $130.7 million in fiscal year 2008. The Company expended $23.9 million
on customer-sponsored research activities during fiscal year 2010, $29.7 million in fiscal year 2009, and $24.8 million in fiscal year 2008.  As of 1 November 2010, the Company owns 932 United States patents, 2,808 foreign patents, and is a licensee under certain patents owned by others. While the patents and licenses are considered important, the
Company does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent, patent license, or group of patents or licenses.  Environmental Controls  The Company is subject to various environmental laws
and regulations in the countries in which it has operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From time to time, the Company is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. Additional
information with respect to these proceedings is included under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, below. The Company’s accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and environmental loss
contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8, below.

Table of Contents
The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental
matters totaled $31.6 million in fiscal 2010, $52.5 million in 2009, and $49.9 million in 2008. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, remedial activities, and activities undertaken to
meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. The 2009 amount included a charge of $16.0 for the Paulsboro site. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information on this charge. The 2008 amount included revised cost estimates for several existing sites.  Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, the Company estimates that in both fiscal year 2010 and 2009, it spent approximately $6 million on capital projects to control pollution. Capital
expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately $6 million in both fiscal year 2011 and 2012. The cost of any environmental compliance generally is contractually passed through to the customer. 
The Company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $87 million to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $101 million. The accrual on the consolidated balance
sheet for 30 September 2010 was $87.0 million and for 30 September 2009 was $95.0 million. Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental
exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a
materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations in any one year.  Employees
 On 30 September 2010, the Company (including majority-owned subsidiaries) had approximately 18,300 employees,
of whom approximately 17,900 were full-time employees and of whom approximately 11,000 were located outside the United States. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with unions at various locations that expire on various dates over the
next four years. The Company considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory and does not believe that the impact of any expiring or expired collective bargaining agreements will result in a material adverse impact on the Company.

Customers 
The Company does not have a homogeneous customer base or end market, and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of the
Company’s consolidated revenues. The Company and the Tonnage Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments do have concentrations of customers in specific industries, primarily refining, chemicals, and electronics. Within each of
these industries, the Company has several large-volume customers with long-term contracts. A negative trend affecting one of these industries, or the loss of one of these major customers, although not material to the Company’s consolidated
revenues, could have an adverse impact on the affected segment.  Governmental Contracts 
No segment’s business is subject to a government entity’s renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts that would
be material to the Company’s business as a whole.  Executive Officers of the Company 
The Company’s executive officers and their respective positions and ages on 15 November 2010 follow. Information with
respect to offices held is stated in fiscal years.

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS 
  You should read the following risk factors carefully in conjunction
with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the
actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and
uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future. 
Overall Economic Conditions—Sluggish general economic conditions in certain markets in which the Company does business may
decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues, operating results, and cash flow. 
Demand for the Company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and
industries in which the Company does business. Recently, sluggish economic conditions in the U.S. and Europe and in certain industries served by the Company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the Company’s products and
services, in turn negatively impacting the Company’s revenues and earnings. While markets have stabilized relative to the extreme economic contraction in 2008—2009, industry utilization rates and therefore pricing pressure continue to be
risks. Excess capacity in the Company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing facilities could decrease the Company’s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits. Unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current
customers can also negatively impact financial results.  Asset Impairments—The Company may be required to record
impairment on its long-lived assets.  Weak demand may cause underutilization of the Company’s manufacturing
capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment; or other events associated
with weak economic conditions or specific end market, product, or customer events may require the Company to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or
goodwill, which would have a negative impact on its financial results.  Competition—Inability to compete
effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.  The Company faces strong
competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in all of its business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing
of the Company’s products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors’ pricing policies could materially affect the Company’s profitability or its market share. 
Raw Material and Energy Cost and Availability—Interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover
increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability. 
Energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of the Company’s
business. Because the Company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, energy price fluctuations could materially impact the Company’s revenues and earnings. Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary
feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and synthesis gas. The Electronics and Performance Materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials, including alcohols, ethyleneamines,

  9 


Table of Contents

cyclohexylamine, acrylonitriles, and glycols. Shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact financial results. A disruption in the supply of energy and raw materials,
whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, natural events, or other disruption, could prevent the Company from meeting its contractual commitments, harming its business and financial results. 
The Company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers, but cost variability
can still have a negative impact on its results. The Company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery. Increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to
customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the Company’s revenues and earnings. Even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume. 
Regulatory Compliance—The Company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which
it does business. Changes in regulations addressing, among other things, environmental compliance, import/export restrictions, and taxes, can negatively impact the Company’s operations and financial results. 
The Company is subject to government regulation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business.
The application of laws and regulations to the Company’s business is sometimes unclear. Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability.
Determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results. Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs. Export controls or
other regulatory restrictions could prevent the Company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. This area continues to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities.
Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the Company’s businesses.  Greenhouse Gases—Legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk.  Some of the Company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the
European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in California and Ontario. In addition, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency has taken preliminary actions towards regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the
effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase the Company’s costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. The Company believes it will be able to mitigate some of
the potential increased cost through its contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate estimate of the long-term impact on the Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could
impact the Company’s growth, increase its operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of its products. 
Environmental Compliance—Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact
the Company’s operations and financial results.  The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and
foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. The Company takes
its environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the
Company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect
financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see “Narrative Description of the Company’s Business Generally—Environmental Controls,” above. 
Foreign Operations, Political, and Legal Risks—The Company’s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by
nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability. 
The Company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk, and some of
its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. Economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, social unrest, or strained relations between

  10 


Table of Contents

countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material, adverse impact on the
Company’s operations and financial results.  Interest Rate Increases—The Company’s earnings, cash flow,
and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases.  At 30 September 2010, the Company had
total consolidated debt of $4,128.3 million, of which $468.5 million will mature in the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt. Although the Company actively
manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations, not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged, and new debt will be priced at market rates. If interest rates increase, the Company’s interest
expense could increase significantly, affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other purposes. In addition, changes by any rating agency to the Company’s outlook or credit
ratings could increase the Company’s cost of borrowing.  Currency Fluctuations—Changes in foreign currencies
may adversely affect the Company’s financial results.  A substantial amount of the Company’s sales are
derived from outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also has significant production facilities which are located outside of the United States. Financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign
currency rates. The Company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects, but it is not cost-effective to hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on
earnings, cash flows, and fair values of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion
of currency exposure, see Item 7A, below.  Pension Liabilities—The Company’s results of operations and
financial condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans.  Adverse equity market
conditions and volatility in the credit markets have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on the value of the Company’s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities, significantly affecting the net periodic
benefit costs of its pension plans and ongoing funding requirements for these plans. As a result, the Company’s financial results and cash flow in any period could be negatively impacted. For information about potential impacts from pension
funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters, see the discussion in Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8, below. 
Catastrophic Events—Catastrophic events could disrupt the Company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or
customers, having a negative impact on the Company’s business, financial results, and cash flow.  The
Company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the Company’s control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and storms, or acts of war and terrorism. Any such event could cause
a serious business disruption that could affect the Company’s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact the Company’s suppliers, in which
event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the Company, or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the Company’s products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the Company’s operations and
financial results.  Operational Risks—Operational and execution risks may adversely affect the Company’s
operations or financial results.  The Company’s operation of its facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems
inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. If operational risks materialize, they could result in loss
of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact the Company’s ongoing operations, financial results, and cash flow. In addition, the Company’s operating results are dependent on the continued
operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements. The Company’s operating facilities for the production of certain product lines, primarily in certain electronic materials products, are highly concentrated.
Insufficient capacity may expose the Company to liabilities related to contract commitments. Operating results are also dependent on the Company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget, and in accordance with
performance requirements. Failure to do so may expose the Company to loss of revenue, potential litigation, and loss of business reputation.

Information Security—The security of the Company’s Information Technology
systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect its ability to operate.  The Company utilizes a global
enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and other technologies for the distribution of information both within the Company and to customers and suppliers. The ERP system and other technologies are potentially vulnerable to interruption from
viruses, hackers, or system breakdown. To mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented a variety of security measures, including virus protection, redundancy procedures, and recovery processes. A significant system interruption, however, could
materially affect the Company’s operations, business reputation, and financial results.  Litigation and
Regulatory Proceedings—The Company’s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving antitrust, environmental, or other matters. 
The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to
additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. The outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to
predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable
estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that
could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in any particular period. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company, see Item 3, below. 
Recruiting and Retaining Employees—Inability to attract, retain, or develop skilled employees could adversely impact the
Company’s business.  Sustaining and growing the Company’s business depends on the recruitment, development,
and retention of qualified employees. Demographic trends and changes in the geographic concentration of global businesses have created more competition for talent. The inability to attract, develop, or retain quality employees could negatively
impact the Company’s ability to take on new projects and sustain its operations, which might adversely affect the Company’s operations or its ability to grow. 
Portfolio Management—The success of portfolio management activities is not predictable. 
The Company continuously reviews and manages its portfolio of assets in order to maximize value for its shareholders. Portfolio
management involves many variables, including future acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings and resegmentations, and cost-cutting and productivity initiatives. The timing, impact, and ability to complete such undertakings; the costs and
financial charges associated with such activities; and the ultimate financial impact of such undertakings are uncertain and can have a negative short- or long-term impact on the Company’s operations and financial results. 
RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE TENDER OFFER FOR AIRGAS 
If the Company is successful in acquiring Airgas, it will incur substantial transaction and merger-related costs. 
If the Company is successful in its tender offer for Airgas (see Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial
statements for more information on this transaction), or otherwise succeeds in acquiring Airgas, it will incur substantial nonrecurring transaction and merger-related costs associated with the acquisition of Airgas, combining the operations of the
two companies, and achieving desired synergies. Although the Company expects that the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the incremental transaction
and merger-related costs, this net benefit may not be achieved when expected, or at all.  The Company will carry
significantly more long-term debt obligations if the acquisition is completed.  At the current tender offer of $65.50
per share, the total value of the Airgas transaction would be approximately $7.4 billion, including $5.7 billion of equity and $1.7 billion of assumed debt. In connection with the tender offer, the Company has secured a $6.7 billion term
loan credit facility (the “bridge loan”), and the Company expects to retain approximately $1 billion of existing Airgas debt. If the tender offer is successful, the Company intends to finance the acquisition primarily by issuing public
debt securities. If the Company is unable to successfully market this debt issuance, the bridge loan will be drawn. The bridge loan carries a higher cost than is anticipated for the public debt.

The issuance and assumption of this new debt will require a greater proportion of the Company’s cash flow from operations to service this debt than the Company has historically had to
allocate to debt.  Changes in our credit ratings may have a negative impact on our financing costs in future periods.
 The Company anticipates that the debt issuance to finance the acquisition of Airgas will result in a temporary
downgrade of its credit ratings. The Company’s credit rating is a significant factor in determining pricing and availability of its debt. Changes in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs. In addition, our current short-term
credit rating allows us to participate in a commercial paper market that has a large number of potential investors and a high degree of liquidity. A downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly our short-term credit rating, could likely reduce the
amount of commercial paper we could issue, increase our commercial paper borrowing costs, or both. The Company expects that its credit rating would be restored to current levels within a few years following the potential acquisition; however,
inability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction or obtain projected prices for assets required to be divested, or other unexpected developments may delay this restoration. 
If the acquisition is completed, we will be subject to integration and other risks. 
If the Company is successful in acquiring Airgas, the success of the merger will depend, in part, on its ability to realize the
anticipated benefits from combining the businesses. To realize these anticipated benefits, the Company must successfully integrate the operations and personnel of Airgas into our business. It is possible that the integration process could take
longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees or the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of
expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, if the acquisition is successful, the Company will be required to divest certain assets to comply with the Consent Decree
approved by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on 8 October 2010. Failure to find suitable buyers or obtain a reasonable price for the assets could adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.

ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES 
  The Company owns its principal executive offices, which are located
at its headquarters in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, and also owns additional administrative offices in Hersham, England and in Hattingen, Germany. Its regional Asian administrative offices, which are leased, are located in Hong Kong; Shanghai, China;
Taipei, Taiwan; Petaling Jaya, Malaysia; and Singapore. Additional administrative offices are leased in Ontario, Canada; Kawasaki, Japan; Seoul, Korea; Brussels, Belgium; Paris, France; Barcelona, Spain; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; São Paulo,
Brazil; and Kempton Park, South Africa. Management believes the Company’s manufacturing facilities, described in more detail below, are adequate to support its businesses. 
Following is a description of the properties used by the Company’s four business segments: 
Merchant Gases  Merchant Gases currently operates over 150 facilities in North and South America (approximately 40 of which sites are owned); over 130 sites in Europe, including healthcare (approximately half of which sites are
owned); and over 75 facilities in seven countries within Asia. Helium is recovered at sites in Kansas and Texas and distributed from several transfill sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. Sales support offices are located at its Trexlertown
headquarters and in leased properties in three states, at all administrative sites in Europe, and at 15 sites in Asia. Research and development (R&D) activities for this segment are conducted in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania. 
Tonnage Gases  Tonnage Gases operates over 50 plants in the United States and Canada that produce over 300 standard tons per day of product. Thirty-five of these facilities produce or recover hydrogen, many of which support the
four major pipeline systems located along the Gulf Coast of Texas; on the Mississippi River corridor in Louisiana; in Los Angeles, California; and Alberta, Canada. The Tonnage Gases segment includes a facility in Pasadena, Texas that produces
Polyurethane Intermediate products. The segment also operates over 20 tonnage plants in Europe and over 20 tonnage plants within Asia, the majority of which are on leasehold type long-term structured agreements. Sales support offices are located at
the Company’s headquarters in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania and leased offices in Texas, Louisiana, California, and Calgary, Alberta in North America, as well as in Hersham, England; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Shanghai, China; Singapore; and Doha,
Qatar in the Middle East.

Electronics and Performance Materials 
The electronics business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment produces, packages, and stores nitrogen, specialty
gases, and electronic chemicals at over 44 sites in the United States (the majority of which are leased), nine facilities in Europe, and over 45 facilities in Asia (approximately half of which are located on customer sites). 
The performance materials portion of this segment operates facilities in Los Angeles, California; Calvert City, Kentucky; Wichita,
Kansas; Milton, Wisconsin; Reserve, Louisiana; Clayton, England; Marl, Germany; Singapore; Isehara, Japan; Changzhou, China and Nanjing, China. Substantially all of the Performance Materials properties are owned. 
This segment has five field sales offices in the United States as well as sales offices in Europe, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, and
China, the majority of which are leased. The segment conducts R&D related activities at eight locations worldwide, including Trexlertown, Pennsylvania; Carlsbad, California; Utrecht, the Netherlands; Hamburg, Germany; Chubei, Taiwan; Giheung,
South Korea; Shanghai, China; and Kawasaki, Japan.  Equipment and Energy 
Equipment and Energy operates eight manufacturing plants and two sales offices in the U.S. The Company manufactures a significant
portion of the world’s supply of LNG equipment at its Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania site. Air separation columns and cold boxes for Company-owned facilities and third-party sales are produced by operations in Istres, France; Caojing, China; as
well as in the Wilkes-Barre facility when capacity is available. Cryogenic transportation containers for liquid helium are manufactured and reconstructed at facilities in eastern Pennsylvania and Liberal, Kansas. Offices in Hersham, England and
Shanghai, China house Equipment commercial team members.  Electric power is produced at various facilities, including
Stockton, California and Calvert City, Kentucky. Flue gas desulfurization operations are conducted at the Pure Air facility in Chesterton, Indiana. Additionally, the Company owns a 47.9% interest in a gas-fueled power generation facility in
Thailand. The Company or its affiliates own approximately 50% of the real estate in this segment and lease the remaining 50%.   


 
ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries
are involved in various legal proceedings, including contract, product liability, intellectual property, and insurance matters. Although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of the Company’s
business, such litigation could result in large monetary awards, especially if a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory and/or punitive damages. However, the Company believes that litigation currently pending to which it is a party will be
resolved without any materially adverse effect on its financial position, earnings, or cash flows.  The Company is also
from time to time involved in certain competition, environmental, health, and safety proceedings involving governmental authorities. The Company is a party to proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act (the federal Superfund law); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there are approximately 30 sites on
which a final settlement has not been reached where the Company, along with others, has been designated a Potentially Responsible Party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup
activity at certain of its current or former manufacturing sites. The Company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in connection with these matters would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position. Additional
information on the Company’s environmental exposure is included under “Narrative Description of the Company’s Business Generally—Environmental Controls.” 
In 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency made a referral to the U.S. Department of Justice concerning alleged violations of
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) related to sulfuric acid exchange at the Company’s Pasadena, Texas facility. The Company disputes the allegations, but has agreed to settle the matter for a $1.485 million civil penalty ($1.35
million to the United States and $135,000 to the State of Texas) and payment of $15,000 to the State of Texas for attorneys’ fees. The settlement was memorialized in a Consent Decree which was lodged with the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, on 25 August 2010 and entered on 29 October 2010.

On 16 February 2010, an unplanned shutdown at the Company’s nitric acid
plant in Pasadena, Texas resulted in the release of nitrogen dioxide and nitric acid into the atmosphere. In connection with the incident, the Company has been contacted by federal, state, and local environmental regulatory authorities, and the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. A complaint alleging various regulatory and air permit violations and seeking unspecified civil penalties, attorneys’ fees, and court costs has been filed by Harris County, Texas. At this time, the
Company does not know whether any fines or penalties will be assessed; however, the Company expects that any resulting fines or penalties will be immaterial to its consolidated financial results. 
In September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) issued a decision against the Company’s
Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R$179.2 million on Air Products Brasil Ltda. This fine was based on a
recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice whose investigation began in 2003, alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases. The fines are based on a percentage of the
Company’s total revenue in Brazil in 2003.  The Company has denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed
an appeal in October 2010 to the Brazilian courts. Certain of the Company’s defenses, if successful, could result in the matter being dismissed with no fine against the Company. The Company, with advice of its outside legal counsel, has
assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is reasonably possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial
statements.  While the Company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in connection with these or any other
legal proceeding would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or net cash flows, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on the Company’s net income in the period in
which it is recorded.

(C)
 Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis include additions to plant and equipment,
investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, and acquisitions (including long-term debt assumed in acquisitions). The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with
facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending
is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the
consolidated statement of cash flows. Refer to page 31 for a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measure for 2010, 2009, and 2008. For 2007 and 2006, the GAAP measure was adjusted by $83 and $129, respectively, for spending associated with
facilities accounted for as capital leases.

   The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this report. All comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated. All amounts presented are in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except as noted. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for share data, unless otherwise indicated. 
Captions such as income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products and net income attributable to Air Products are
simply referred to as “income from continuing operations” and “net income” throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, unless otherwise stated. 
The discussion of results that follows includes non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures exclude acquisition-related
costs in 2010. For 2009, the non-GAAP measures exclude the global cost reduction plan charge, costs related to customer bankruptcy and asset actions and third quarter 2009 pension settlement costs. For 2008, the non-GAAP measures exclude pension
settlement costs. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that the Company’s management uses internally to evaluate the Company’s baseline performance on a
comparable basis. The reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures is presented on pages 28—29.  
BUSINESS OVERVIEW  Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company or Air Products) serves
technology, energy, industrial, and healthcare customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, equipment, and services.
Geographically diverse, with operations in over 40 countries, the Company has sales of $9.0 billion, assets of $13.5 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 18,300 employees. 
The Company organizes its operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and
Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy.  2010 IN SUMMARY 
In 2010, the Company emerged from the recession and delivered strong growth and productivity. Sales increased 9% and underlying
sales increased 8%, due to strong volume growth as the economic environment improved. These results were driven by a significant recovery in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment and new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases
segment. Operating income increased due to improved performance across all business segments.  The Company delivered
significant improvements in 2010 as a result of actions taken to lower costs and position the Company for success coming out of the global recession. These actions included the completion of the Company’s global cost reduction plans and
Electronics business restructuring. Additionally, the Company repositioned its manufacturing centers, continued to leverage the SAP system, and further utilized its shared service centers. These actions contributed to increased productivity and
improved operating results.

In February 2010, the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas). Airgas is the largest packaged industrial gases distributor in the U.S. Its fiscal year 2010 annual revenues were $3.9 and its total assets as of 31 March 2010 were $4.5. The current offer price
is $65.50 per share. At this price, the total value of the transaction would be approximately $7.4 billion, including $5.7 billion of equity and $1.7 billon of assumed debt. The offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire on
3 December 2010, unless further extended.  Highlights for 2010 
 


 
•
 
 Sales of $9,026.0 increased 9%, or $769.8. Underlying business increased 8%, primarily due to higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials and
Tonnage Gases segments. 
   


 
•
 
 Operating income of $1,389.0 increased 64%, or $542.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,485.0 increased 25%, or $300.4, primarily due to higher
volumes, lower costs, and favorable currency and foreign exchange, partially offset by reduced pricing. 
   


 
•
 
 Income from continuing operations of $1,029.1 increased 61%, or $389.2, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.74 increased 58%, or
$1.74. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,089.2 increased 26%, or $223.0, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.02 increased 24%, or $.96. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share
is presented below.

2011 OUTLOOK 
The Company projects that the gradual economic recovery will continue and that manufacturing will be the leading sector in the
recovery. The Company anticipates global manufacturing growth of 3%–4% in 2011, with stronger growth in Asia and more gradual recoveries in the U.S. and Europe. The Company expects the U.S. will have positive growth of 3%–4% in
manufacturing. Europe should increase about 1%–2% and Asia, led by China, is expected to continue as the strongest region, growing at 6%–7%.  Looking forward, the Company expects volume growth to be the key factor in driving earnings improvement in 2011. Earnings should benefit from new plant onstreams in 2010 and 2011, along with the loading of existing
assets. These volume gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense next year, as a result of a decline in the discount rates from September 2009 to September 2010 and lower expected asset returns. Based upon current rates, the Company
does not expect currency to have a significant impact on 2011 earnings. The Company will continue to focus on cost control and will achieve benefits from the cost reduction efforts completed. 
If the proposed acquisition of Airgas is consummated in 2011, material impacts affecting most items in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements are expected. In addition, projections, estimates and plans described in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis would be materially impacted. Except where noted, the Outlook discussions provided throughout
the Management’s Discussion and Analysis do not include any impacts of the proposed transaction.  Outlook by
Segment 


 
•
 
 Merchant Gases should benefit as capacity utilization of existing facilities continues to improve globally and as new demand develops, particularly in Asia.
Global manufacturing growth, along with new technology applications should continue to increase demand which will drive the loading of facilities. 
   


 
•
 
 Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from the full-year loading of the 2010 new plant start-ups, along with several investments due to come onstream in 2011.

   


 
•
 
 In Electronics, the Company projects silicon growth of 5%–10% and slow, steady growth of the business with the newer photovoltaic (PV) and light-emitting
diode (LED) businesses growing at higher rates. In the integrated circuit business, the Company is well positioned with the industry leaders that are starting up new fabrication plants and expanding capacity. The electronics equipment business
should also grow in 2011 due to anticipated continued electronics industry capital spending. Growth is expected in Performance Materials as the Company leverages low cost production facilities in Asia. Additionally, Performance Materials continues
to benefit from new product, market and application successes. 
   


 
•
 
 Equipment and Energy results are expected to be comparable to 2010 levels. Two to three liquefied natural gas (LNG) orders are expected to be signed in 2011.

Table of Contents
2010 vs. 2009 
Sales of $9,026.0 increased 9%, or $769.8. Underlying business increased 8%, driven by volume increases in the Electronics and
Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments, as the economic environment improved. These results were driven by a significant recovery in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment and new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases
segment.  2009 vs. 2008  Sales of $8,256.2 decreased 21%, or $2,158.3. Underlying business declined 8%, due to lower volumes primarily in Electronics and Performance Materials, Merchant Gases, and Tonnage Gases. Volumes were impacted by
the severity of the worldwide manufacturing downturn and a significant decline in silicon processed. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 6%, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. Lower
energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers reduced sales by 7%.  Operating Income
 2010 vs. 2009  Operating income of $1,389.0 increased 64%, or $542.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,485.0 increased 25%, or $300.4.   


 
•
 
 Underlying business increased $275, primarily from higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments and lower costs,
partially offset by reduced pricing. 
   


 
•
 
 Favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts increased operating income by $25. 
  2009 vs. 2008 
Operating income of $846.3 decreased 43%, or $649.5. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,184.6 decreased 22%, or $337.5.
  


 
•
 
 Underlying business declined $254, due primarily to lower volumes in the Merchant Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Tonnage Gases segments. The
volume declines of $490 were partially offset by favorable cost performance of $157 and improved pricing of $79. 
   


 
•
 
 Unfavorable currency impacts lowered operating income by $113, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies.

   


 
•
 
 Operating income in 2008 included unfavorable impacts of $28 due to hurricanes and a fire at a production facility. 
  Equity Affiliates’ Income 
2010 vs. 2009  Income from equity affiliates of $126.9 increased $14.7, or 13%, primarily due to higher volumes.  2009 vs. 2008  Income from equity affiliates of $112.2 decreased $32.8, or 23%,
primarily as a result of lower overall volumes and unfavorable currency. Additionally, 2008 results included favorable adjustments made to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine. 
Selling and Administrative Expense (S&A) 
2010 vs. 2009  S&A expense of $956.9 increased $13.5, or 1%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by improved productivity and the impact of the global cost reduction plan. S&A as a
percent of sales decreased to 10.6% from 11.4%.  2009 vs. 2008 
S&A expense of $943.4 decreased $147.0, or 13%. Underlying costs decreased 8%, primarily due to improved productivity as well as
the impact of the global cost reduction plan, lower incentive compensation costs, and lower discretionary spending. This decrease was partially offset by inflation and higher bad debt expense. Favorable currency impacts, primarily the strengthening
of the dollar against the Euro and Pound Sterling, decreased S&A by 6%. The acquisition of CryoService Limited in the third quarter of 2008 increased S&A by 1%. S&A as a percent of sales, increased to 11.4% from 10.5%, due
principally to the impact of lower energy and raw material cost pass-through on sales. 
  21 


Table of Contents
2011 Outlook 
S&A expense will increase in 2011 due to additional costs to support volume growth and the impacts of cost inflation. These
increases will be partially offset by ongoing productivity initiatives.  Research and Development (R&D)
 2010 vs. 2009  R&D expense of $114.7 decreased 1%, or $1.6, primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions. R&D as a percent of sales decreased to 1.3% from 1.4%. 
2009 vs. 2008  R&D expense of $116.3 decreased $14.4, primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions. R&D as a percent of sales increased to 1.4% from 1.3%. 
2011 Outlook  R&D expense is expected to be moderately higher in 2011.  Global Cost Reduction
Plan  The 2009 results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after-tax, or $.94 per
share) for the global cost reduction plan. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company announced the global cost reduction plan, designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions
around the world. The 2009 first-quarter results included a charge of $174.2 ($116.1 after-tax, or $.55 per share). In the third quarter 2009, due to the continuing slow economic recovery, the Company committed to additional actions associated with
its global cost reduction plan that resulted in a charge of $124.0 ($84.2 after-tax, or $.39 per share). The total 2009 charge included $210.0 for severance and other benefits, including pension-related costs, associated with the elimination of
approximately 2,550 positions from the Company’s global workforce. The remainder of this charge, $88.2, was for business exits and asset management actions. 
During 2010, the Company revised its estimate of the costs associated with the 2009 global cost reduction plan. The unfavorable
impact of additional severance and other benefits was primarily offset by favorable variances related to completed business exits and asset management actions. These adjustments to the charge were excluded from segment operating profit and did not
have a material impact on any individual segment.  As of 30 September 2010, the planned actions associated with
the global cost reduction plan were substantially completed, with the exception of certain benefit payments associated with a small number of position eliminations. In addition, as part of the asset management actions included in the plan, the
Company anticipates completing the sale of a facility by the end of calendar year 2010. Refer to Note 5, Global Cost Reduction Plan, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this charge. 
Cost savings of approximately $155 were achieved through 2010. Beyond 2010, the Company expects annualized, ongoing savings of
approximately $180, of which the majority is related to personnel costs.  Acquisition-Related Costs 
In 2010, $96.0 ($60.1 after-tax, or $.28 per share) in expense was recognized related to the Airgas transaction and is included
within acquisition-related costs on the consolidated income statement. Refer to Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for details of these costs. 
Customer Bankruptcy and Asset Actions 
On 6 January 2009, a customer of the Company who principally receives product from the Tonnage Gases segment began operating
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result, the Company recognized a $22.2 ($13.9 after- tax, or $.07 per share) charge primarily for the write-off of certain receivables during the third quarter of 2009. Sales and operating income
associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment’s results.  In April 2010, the customer
emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. The Company received a final settlement in the amount of $22.4, of which $16.0 was applied against the remaining outstanding receivables. Income of $6.4 ($4.0 after-tax, or $.02 per share) was recognized for the
recovery of certain receivables that had been previously written off. This amount was recorded as a gain and is reflected within customer bankruptcy on the consolidated income statement. 
In the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $9.9 ($7.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) for other asset actions
which consisted of the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. This charge was reflected in cost of sales on the consolidated income statement. The 2009 customer bankruptcy charge combined with this asset write-down resulted in a total charge
of $32.1 ($21.0 after-tax, or $.10 per share).

Pension Settlement 
The Company’s U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for
corporate officers, six months after the participant’s retirement date. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal
year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. The Company recognized $11.5, $10.7, and $30.3 of settlement charges in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information.  Other Income, Net 
Items recorded to other income arise from transactions and events not directly related to the principal income earning activities of
the Company. The detail of other income is presented in Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements.  2010 vs. 2009  Other income of $38.7 increased $15.7, primarily due to a net
gain on the sale of assets and favorable foreign exchange. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year.  2009 vs. 2008  Other income of $23.0 decreased by $2.8. Other income declined
due to losses from asset sales in 2009 and unfavorable foreign exchange. Other income in 2008 included a loss related to fire damage at a production facility. No other items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year.

$162.0
   2010 vs. 2009  Interest incurred decreased $7.6. The decrease was driven by
lower average interest rates on variable rate debt, partially offset by a higher average debt balance and the impact of a weaker dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest. The change in capitalized interest is driven by a decrease in
project spending which qualified for capitalization.  2009 vs. 2008 
Interest incurred decreased by $40.3. This decrease was primarily driven by lower average interest rates on variable rate debt. The
impact of a stronger dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest was offset by a higher average debt balance. Capitalized interest was comparable to 2008 due to slightly higher project levels offset by lower average interest rates.
 2011 Outlook  The Company expects interest incurred to be modestly higher. This increase is expected to result from a higher average debt balance, higher fees on the Company’s committed credit facility, and slightly higher
interest rates on variable rate debt.  Effective Tax Rate 
The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 22,
Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate.  2010
vs. 2009  On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.4% and 22.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. On a non-GAAP
basis, the effective tax rate was 25.2% and 25.3% in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  2009 vs. 2008 
On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 22.1% and 24.7% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax
rate was 25.3% and 24.9% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher in 2009 due to lower tax credits and adjustments. 
  23 


Table of Contents
2011 Outlook 
The Company expects the effective tax rate in 2011 to be approximately 25.0% to 26.0%. 
Discontinued Operations  The U.S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have
been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 6, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
U.S. Healthcare  In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, the Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after-tax, or $1.12 per share) related
to the impairment/write-down of the net carrying value of U.S. Healthcare business.  In the first half of 2009, based on
additional facts, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share), reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the business. Also, tax benefits of $25.5, or $.12 per share, were recorded to
revise the estimated tax benefit associated with the total impairment charges recorded.  During the third quarter of
2009, the Company sold more than half of its remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $38.1. The Company recognized an after-tax gain of $.3 resulting from the sales combined with adjustments to net realizable value of the remaining
businesses.  During the fourth quarter of 2009, through a series of transactions, the Company sold its remaining U.S.
Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $12.1. A net after-tax loss of $.7 was recognized. These transactions completed the disposal of the U.S. Healthcare business. 
The U.S. Healthcare business generated sales of $125.2 and $239.8, and a loss from operations, net of tax, of $3.4 and $259.4 in
2009 and 2008, respectively. The loss from operations in 2008 included an after-tax impairment charge of $237.0. 
Polymer Emulsions Business  On 31 January 2008, the Company closed on the sale of its interest in its vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE) polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. As part of that
agreement, the Company received Wacker Chemie AG’s interest in the Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and their related businesses plus cash proceeds of $258.2. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $89.5 ($57.7
after-tax, or $.26 per share).  On 30 June 2008, the Company sold its Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production
facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses to Ashland, Inc. The Company recorded a gain of $30.5 ($18.5 after-tax, or $.08 per share) in connection with the sale, which included
the recording of a retained environmental obligation associated with the Piedmont site. The sale of the Elkton and Piedmont facilities completed the disposal of the Company’s Polymer Emulsions business. 
The Polymer Emulsion business generated sales of $261.4 and income from operations, net of tax, of $16.7 in 2008. 
HPPC Business  In 2008, the Company sold its HPPC business to KMG Chemicals, Inc. The sale closed on 31 December 2007, and a loss on the sale was recorded of $.5 ($.3 after-tax) in 2008. The HPPC business generated sales of
$22.9 and income from operations, net of tax, of $.1 in 2008.  Net Income 
2010 vs. 2009  Net income was $1,029.1 compared to $631.3, and diluted earnings per share was $4.74 compared to $2.96. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $1,089.2 compared to $857.6, and diluted earnings per share was $5.02
compared to $4.02.  2009 vs. 2008 
Net income was $631.3 compared to $909.7, and diluted earnings per share was $2.96 compared to $4.15. On a non-GAAP basis, net
income was $857.6 compared to $926.2, and diluted earnings per share was $4.02 compared to $4.23.

(14
)%  2010 vs. 2009  Sales of $3,718.3 increased by 3%, or $107.7. Sales increased 2%
from favorable currency effects, due to a weaker U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies in the first half of the year. Underlying business increased 1% as volume increases, primarily in Asia, were partially offset by a decrease in
pricing due to liquid hydrogen natural gas cost pass-through and unfavorable customer mix.  In North America, sales were
flat, as volume increases were offset by lower pricing and unfavorable customer mix. In Europe, sales were flat as favorable currency impacts were offset by lower pricing and unfavorable customer mix. In Asia, sales increased 20%, with volumes up
16% and a favorable currency impact of 4%. Volume increases were driven by steel, electronics and bulk hydrogen customers. 
Merchant Gases Operating Income  Operating income of $729.4 increased 10%, or $68.2. The increase was primarily due to lower costs of $50, higher volumes of $32 and favorable currency of $8, partially offset by lower pricing and unfavorable
customer mix of $22. The improved costs resulted from improved plant operating costs, distribution efficiency, and organizational restructuring benefits.  Merchant Gases Equity Affiliates’ Income  Merchant Gases equity
affiliates’ income of $104.3 increased 6%, or $6.0. The increase was a result of higher volumes.  2009 vs. 2008
 Merchant Gases Sales  Sales of $3,610.6 decreased by 14%, or $582.1. Sales decreased 9% from unfavorable currency effects, driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. Underlying
sales declined 5%, with volumes down 9% and pricing up 4%. Volumes were weak across manufacturing end markets globally. Price increases implemented early in the year were effective, partially offsetting the decline in volume. 
The global recession significantly impacted manufacturing-related demand for Merchant industrial gases in every region. In North
America, sales decreased 10%, with volumes down 14%. Higher pricing of 4% partially offset the decline in volumes. In Europe, sales decreased 17%, primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts of 13%. Underlying sales declined 4%, with volumes down
8% and pricing adding 4%. Stronger healthcare volumes partially offset the total volume decline. In Asia, sales declined 13%. Underlying sales were lower by 6%, with volumes declining 8% and pricing adding 2%. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by
7%.  Merchant Gases Operating Income 
Operating income of $661.2 decreased 16%, or $128.3. The decline was due to reduced volumes of $234 and unfavorable currency impacts

11% due to continued improvement in steel and chemical end markets and new plant onstreams. Currency favorably impacted sales by 2%, driven primarily by the weaker U.S. dollar, in the first half of 2010. Energy and raw material contractual cost
pass-through to customers increased sales by 1%.  Tonnage Gases Operating Income 
Operating income of $444.2 increased 11%, or $44.6. The increase was a result of higher volumes of $79 and favorable currency
impacts of $7, partially offset by higher costs of $41, primarily due to planned maintenance costs and operating inefficiencies.  2009 vs. 2008  Tonnage Gases Sales 
Sales of $2,573.6 decreased 28%, or $1,000.8. Lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers reduced sales
by 19%. Volumes were down 5%. While refinery hydrogen volumes were higher, overall volumes declined from reduced demand from steel and chemical customers. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 4%. 
Tonnage Gases Operating Income  Operating income of $399.6 decreased 17%, or $83.0. Underlying business declined $70, primarily from decreased volumes and lower operating efficiencies. Currency unfavorably impacted operating income by $24.

increased due to higher volumes of 22% across all markets, partially offset by unfavorable pricing of 3%. Electronics sales increased 17% due to higher volumes in specialty materials and equipment sales in support of fabrication plant expansions,
partially offset by lower pricing. Performance Materials sales increased 25%, reflecting volume growth across end markets globally, partially offset by lower pricing. 
Electronics and Performance Materials Operating Income 
Operating income of $251.8 increased $150.2, primarily due to higher volumes of $160 and lower costs of $40, partially offset by
lower pricing of $50. The reduced costs were a result of restructuring and productivity initiatives.  2009 vs. 2008
 Electronics and Performance Materials Sales 
Sales of $1,582.2 declined 28%, or $627.1, as volumes declined 24%. Sales volumes declined significantly in the first half of 2009
and recovered sequentially in the second half. In Electronics, sales were down 35%, reflecting a significant global downturn in semiconductor and flat-panel capacity utilization and capital investment. In Performance Materials, sales were down 19%
due to weaker demand across all end markets, partially offset by improved pricing.  Electronics and Performance
Materials Operating Income  Operating income of $101.6 declined by 59%, or $144.3. Operating income declined from
lower volumes of $202 as well as unfavorable pricing of $37. Lower pricing in Electronics was partially offset by higher pricing in Performance Materials. Favorable cost performance added $82, primarily due to cost reduction efforts. Results in 2008
included $15 of unfavorable impacts associated with a fire at a production facility.  Equipment and Energy

The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2010 was $274, compared to $239 at 30 September 2009. It
is expected that approximately $250 of the backlog will be completed during 2011.  2009 vs. 2008 
Sales of $489.8 increased by 12%, or $51.7, due to higher ASU activity. Operating income improved $3.3 from favorable cost
performance and higher ASU sales, partially offset by lower LNG heat exchanger activity and unfavorable currency.  The
sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2009 was $239, compared to $399 at 30 September 2008.

Other 
Other operating income (loss) includes other expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments,
including foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income, and costs previously allocated to businesses now reported as discontinued operations. Also included are LIFO inventory adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO and the LIFO pool
adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate general and administrative costs and research and development costs are fully allocated to the business segments. 
2010 vs. 2009  Operating loss was $2.6 compared to $17.3, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange in the current year. No other individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 
2009 vs. 2008  Operating loss of $17.3 decreased by $13.5. The decrease was primarily due to favorable LIFO inventory adjustments versus 2008. Unfavorable currency partially offset this decline. No other items were individually
significant in comparison to the prior year.  RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing
measures which the Company’s management uses internally to evaluate the Company’s baseline performance on a comparable basis. Presented below are reconciliations of the reported GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures.

)  Operating Activities  2010 vs. 2009 
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $193.0, or 15%. The increase resulted from higher net income of $397.8 combined
with the favorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of $191.2, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of $396.0.  Noncash adjustments include depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, deferred taxes, certain acquisition-related costs and share-based compensation cost. These adjustments also include changes in
operating assets, such as noncurrent capital lease receivables, and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt or disbursement of cash and their recognition in earnings. 
Favorable noncash adjustments to net income in 2010 primarily included the following: 
 


 
•
 
 An increase in deferred income taxes of $148.5 due to pension funding and the utilization of foreign tax credits. 
   


 
•
 
 Expense of $84.0 for the amortization of financing costs associated with the Airgas tender offer. 
   


 
•
 
 A decrease in noncurrent capital lease receivables of $101.1. 
  These favorable adjustments were partially offset by the impact of
2009 noncash impairment charges of $118.7 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued U.S. Healthcare business.  Changes in working capital increased cash used (negative cash flow variance) by $396.0 and included:   


 
•
 
 A $301.5 negative cash flow variance due to higher trade receivables. The current year reflected a negative cash flow of $142.5 caused by rising sales, while the
prior year reflected a positive cash flow of $159.0 resulting from a significant drop in sales. 
   


 
•
 
 A $94.6 negative cash flow variance from inventories and contracts in progress primarily due to increased spending for inventory and projects to support higher
business activity. 
  2009 vs. 2008 
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $329.4, or 20%. The decrease resulted from the reduction in net income of $278.4
combined with the unfavorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of $143.4, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of $92.4. Net income in 2009 included noncash impairment charges of $118.7 related to the global cost reduction
plan and the discontinued U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, U.S. Healthcare noncash impairment charges totaling $314.8 were partially offset by gains of $105.9 on the sale of discontinued operations. Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses
are reflected as an investing activity.  Changes in working capital decreased cash used (positive cash flow variance) by
$92.4 and included:   


 
•
 
 A $256.4 positive cash flow variance due to lower trade receivables as a result of lower sales. 
   


 
•
 
 A $108.7 positive cash flow variance from other receivables due primarily to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 2008 related to the U.S. Healthcare
impairment charge. The recognition of this asset represented a use of cash in 2008. 
   


 
•
 
 A $319.0 negative cash flow variance due to a higher use of cash for payables and accrued liabilities. This variance was due to a lower level of activity and the
timing of payments.

Investing Activities 
2010 vs. 2009  Cash used for investing increased $16.1, primarily due to:   


 
•
 
 Capital expenditures for plant and equipment decreased by $148.2, consistent with the Company’s capital spending plan. 
   


 
•
 
 The Company purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for $69.6 prior to a tender offer as discussed in Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the
consolidated financial statements. 
   


 
•
 
 Changes in restricted cash, due to lower project spending, resulted in a reduced source of cash of $53.4. The proceeds from the issuance of certain Industrial
Revenue Bonds must be held in escrow until related project spending occurs and are classified as noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet. 
   


 
•
 
 The prior year included proceeds of $51.0 from the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. 
  2009 vs. 2008 
Cash used for investing increased $120.6, primarily from lower proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of $372.0,
partially offset by changes in restricted cash of $270.6.   


 
•
 
 During 2009, the Company completed the sale of its U.S. Healthcare business, which generated proceeds of $51.0. In 2008, proceeds of $423.0 included the sales of
the Polymer Emulsions and HPPC businesses. 
   


 
•
 
 Decreases in the restricted cash balances, caused by project spending exceeding new bond proceeds, resulted in a source of cash of $87.0 in 2009. Activity in
2008 resulted in a use of cash of $183.6.

(B)
 The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital
leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. 
   


 
•
 
 Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such
spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. 
   


 
•
 
 Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in
the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
  Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2010 totaled $1,133.8,
compared to $1,236.3 in 2009, resulting in a reduction of $102.5. Additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses during both 2010 and 2009. Additions to plant and equipment also included
support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. 
Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2010 totaled $1,298.4, compared to $1,474.9 in 2009. Capital lease expenditures of
$122.6 decreased by $116.0, reflecting lower project spending. In 2009, capital lease expenditures of $238.6 increased $42.9 from 2008, reflecting higher project spending, primarily in North America Tonnage Gases. 
2011 Outlook  Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2011 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,400 and $1,500, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,500 and $1,700.
The non-GAAP capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases which are expected to be between $100 and $200. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with

  31 


Table of Contents

approximately $1,000 associated with new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, the Company intends to
continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates.  Financing Activities
 2010 vs. 2009  Cash used by financing activities increased $674.7, primarily due to:   


 
•
 
 A decrease in long-term proceeds of $384.3. The prior year included proceeds of $400.0 from the issuance of a fixed-rate 4.375% 10-year senior note.

   


 
•
 
 An increase in payments on long-term debt of $353.5, resulting primarily from the repayment of a €250 Eurobond ($306.8). 
  2009 vs. 2008 
Cash provided by financing activities increased $772.7, primarily as a result of share repurchases of $793.4 in 2008. In 2009, the
Company did not purchase any of its outstanding shares.  Financing and Capital Structure 
Capital needs in 2010 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2010, total debt outstanding was $4.1
billion compared to $4.5 billion, and cash and cash items were $.4 billion compared to $.5 billion. Total debt at 30 September 2010 and 2009, expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt and total equity, was 42.0% and 47.7%,
respectively.  Long-term debt proceeds of $226.2 included $85.0 from the issuance of Industrial Revenue Bonds. Refer to
Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  In February 2010, the Company
commenced a tender offer to acquire all outstanding common stock of Airgas as further discussed in Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with this tender offer, the Company has secured committed
financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. Borrowings under this credit facility will be available beginning on the date of the consummation of the tender offer, which must occur no later than 4 February 2011. All
borrowings under this credit facility will mature on the date that is one year from the consummation of the tender offer. The credit facility agreement contains one financial covenant, a maximum leverage ratio, and other affirmative and negative
covenants, including restrictions on liens and certain subsidiary indebtedness. It also requires mandatory commitment reduction/prepayment for certain capital market transactions and asset dispositions. Fees incurred to secure this credit facility
have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the arrangement.  The Company has obtained the commitment of
a number of commercial banks to lend money at market rates whenever needed. At 30 September 2009, the Company’s total multicurrency committed credit facility amounted to $1,450. On 8 July 2010, the Company replaced this facility with
a new $2,000 multicurrency committed credit facility maturing on 8 July 2013. Facility fees were modified to reflect current market rates. The Company has one financial covenant associated with this new credit facility. The covenant indicates
that the ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) shall not exceed 3.0. This credit facility provides a source of liquidity and is used to support the issuance of commercial paper. No borrowings
were outstanding under this commitment at the end of 2010. Additional commitments totaling $518.7 are maintained by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, of which $345.2 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2010. 
In 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of the Company’s outstanding common stock. During
2010, the Company did not purchase any shares under this authorization. At 30 September 2010, $649.2 in share repurchase authorization remained.  2011 Outlook  Exclusive of the potential Airgas transaction described above,
the Company projects a limited need to access the long-term debt markets in 2011 due to its projected operating cash flows, modest debt maturities and available cash balance at the end of 2010. Should the Airgas transaction occur, the Company
expects to fund this acquisition primarily with new debt financing. The Company expects that it will continue to be in compliance with all of its financial covenants. Also, the Company anticipates that it will continue to be able to access the
commercial paper and other short-term debt markets.

Dividends 
On 18 March 2010, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.45 per share to $.49 per share. Dividends
are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. 
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional
purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes these obligations of the Company as of 30 September 2010:

   Long-Term Debt Obligations  The long-term debt obligations include the maturity
payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. 
Contractual interest is the interest the Company is contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account
the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. The Company had $1,240 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at
30 September 2010, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2010.
Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates.  Leases  Refer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information on capital and operating leases.  Pension Obligations 
The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company that in total equal the
recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. 
The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets,
continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions.  Unconditional Purchase Obligations  Most of the Company’s long-term
unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay
sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer
sales contracts, the Company does not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.
 The above unconditional purchase obligations include other product supply commitments and also electric power and
natural gas supply purchase obligations. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $330 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2011. 
  33 


Table of Contents
The Company also purchases materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and
services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market
prices. In total, purchases by the Company approximate $6.3 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above.  Other Liabilities  Other liabilities includes the obligation to purchase the
remaining outstanding shares of the French SAGA group (SAGA) for a fixed price of €44.8, or approximately $61, and the obligation to
purchase 25% of the remaining shares of CryoService Limited (CSL) for $42.0.  In the second quarter of 2010, the Company
entered into agreements that will enable it to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of SAGA. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company purchased 51.47% of the shares in March 2010. The remaining shares are expected to be purchased by the
end of calendar year 2010 for a fixed price of €44.8, or approximately $61, under a put and call option structure. At 30 September
2010, this structure was accounted for as a financing of the purchase of the remaining shares and reported within short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 4, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.  Additionally, in June 2010, the Company entered into agreements obligating it to
purchase 25% of the remaining shares of CSL. The agreements require the consideration, which is based on a multiple of earnings formula, to be remitted in January 2012. At 30 September 2010, the liability amounted to $42.0 and has been reported
in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 20, Noncontrolling Interests, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Income Tax Liabilities  Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2010 were $335.1. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions
as of 30 September 2010 were $233.7. These tax liabilities were not included in the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year. 
PENSION BENEFITS 
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide
employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans—the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. The move to defined contribution
plans has not had a material impact on retirement program cost levels or funding. Over the long run, however, the defined contribution plans are expected to reduce volatility of both expense and contributions. 
For 2010, the fair market value of pension plan assets for the Company’s defined benefit plans as of the measurement date
increased to $2,711.6 from $2,251.0 in 2009. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $3,753.6 and $3,386.0 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the obligation was due principally to a decrease in
the weighted average discount rate used to measure future benefit obligations to 5.0% from 5.6%. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on the Company’s
postretirement benefits.  Pension Expense

contributions. Expense in 2010 included $14.8 of special termination and settlement charges, of which $2.8 was related to the global cost reduction plan.

Table of Contents
2009 vs. 2008 
The decrease in pension expense was primarily attributable to the 100 basis point increase in the weighted average discount rate.
Expense in 2009 included $43.8 of special termination, settlement, and curtailment charges, of which $32.3 was related to the global cost reduction plan.  2011 Outlook  Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $122 in 2011, an
increase of $27.8 from 2010, net of special terminations and settlements. In 2011, pension expense will include approximately $94 for amortization of actuarial losses versus $66.8 in 2010. Actuarial losses of $294.8 were incurred in 2010, resulting
primarily from lower discount rates. Actuarial gains/losses, in excess of certain thresholds, are amortized into pension expense over the average remaining service lives of the employees to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses.
Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2011. 
Pension Funding  Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans. With respect to funded plans, the Company’s funding policy is that contributions, combined with
appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.  In addition, the
Company makes contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing its capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. The Company analyzes the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide
the level of contributions. During 2010 and 2009, the Company’s cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans were $406.6 and $184.8, respectively. The majority of the cash contributions were voluntary.
 Cash contributions to defined benefit plans, including benefit payments for unfunded plans, are estimated to be
approximately $247 in 2011. Of this amount, $200 was contributed in October 2010. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the
Contractual Obligations discussion on page 33 for a projection of future contributions. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations. Compliance with
these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From time to time, the Company is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law),
similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. The Company’s accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in
Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. 
The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $31.6, $52.5, and $49.9 in 2010,
2009, and 2008, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, remedial activities, and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially
different from these amounts. The 2009 amount included a charge of $16.0 for the Paulsboro site. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this charge. The 2008 amount
included revised cost estimates for several existing sites.  Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, the
Company estimates that in both 2010 and 2009, it spent approximately $6 on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $6 in both 2011 and 2012. 
The Company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $87 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $101. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2010
and 2009 included an accrual of $87.0 and $95.0, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and the Paulsboro, New Jersey facilities is included in these amounts. Refer to
Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities.

Table of Contents
Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the
estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters
in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in any one year.  Some of the Company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the
European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in California and Ontario. In the U.S., regional
initiatives have been implemented that will regulate GHG emissions from fossil fuel-driven power plants, and some federal legislative proposals also focus on such power plants. As a large consumer of electric power, the Company could be impacted by
increased costs that may arise from such regulatory controls. In addition, federal legislation has been introduced in the U.S. that would regulate GHG emissions from the Company’s hydrogen facilities and other operations, such as production of
fluorinated gases manufactured by the Company. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken preliminary actions towards regulating GHG emissions. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S.
federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG.  The Company may incur costs related to
GHG emissions from its hydrogen facilities and other operations such as fluorinated gases production. The Company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through its contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation
or regulatory requirements prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on the Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from Company facilities could impact the Company’s growth by increasing its operating costs or
reducing demand for certain of its products.  Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for the Company. The
Company continues to develop technologies to help its facilities and its customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. The Company is also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power
and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and the Company’s carbon capture solutions could
increase demand for oxygen, one of the Company’s main products, and the Company’s proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  The Company has
entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The Company is not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. The Company does not have
any derivative instruments indexed to its own stock. The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Company’s principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. The Company
did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties. 
INFLATION  The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years’ inflation. While the U.S. inflation rate has been modest for several years,
the Company operates in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is
estimated that the cost of replacing the Company’s plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes the Company’s major accounting policies.
Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the Company’s accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires

  36 


Table of Contents

management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates
made, the reported results could be materially affected. The Company’s management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with its audit committee. 
Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment 
Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2010 totaled $7,051.3, and depreciation expense totaled $837.7 during 2010. Plant
and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. 
Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the Company, which may be less than
its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material
availability, and geographic location.  The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its
appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally
anticipated. In these cases, the Company would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is
increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.  The Company
has numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply
contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term
contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the
production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term.  The depreciable lives of production facilities within the
Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and
Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such
as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. 
A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance
Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below:

)  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Plant and Equipment 
Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows.
Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a
long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the
expected useful life of the long-lived assets. There were no such events or changes in circumstances that occurred during the reporting periods.  If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group
is determined to be 
  37 


Table of Contents

impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the
discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales
volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment
reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. 
Goodwill  The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $60.2, was $974.8
as of 30 September 2010. The majority of the Company’s goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10,
Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.  The Company performs an impairment test annually in the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires the Company to compare the fair value
of business reporting units to carrying value, including assigned goodwill. The Company has designated its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available
and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. Currently, the Company has four business segments and fifteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business
segment.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment. The
Company determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. 
The Company primarily uses an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows, to determine
fair value of a reporting unit. The Company’s valuation model uses a five-year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate
valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business, long-term contractual nature of the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by the Company’s reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry.
The principal assumptions utilized in the Company’s income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent
with those utilized in the Company’s operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted-average cost of capital which includes factors such as the risk-free rate
of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and
current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. 
Intangible Assets  Intangible assets at 30 September 2010 totaled $285.7 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents, and technology. The Company has no acquired intangible assets with indefinite
lives. Intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may not be recoverable. See impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined.  Equity Investments  Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled
$912.8 at 30 September 2010. The majority of the Company’s investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized 
  38 


Table of Contents

financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.  In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value
of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an
impairment charge.  Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2010, accrued income taxes and deferred tax liabilities
amounted to $73.6 and $335.1, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2010 were $233.7. Current and noncurrent deferred tax assets equaled $209.6 at 30 September 2010. Income tax expense was
$339.5 for the year ended 30 September 2010. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the
realization of deferred tax assets.  Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income
tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The Company believes that its recorded tax liabilities adequately provide
for the probable outcome of these assessments.  Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance
is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted
future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is
reported in the current period tax expense.  A 1% point increase/decrease in the Company’s effective tax rate would
have decreased/increased net income by approximately $14.  Pension Benefits 
The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined
on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. 
Actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These
models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. 
Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans.
The Company determines assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates
on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. The Company believes the actuarial assumptions are
reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. 
One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit
obligations back to the measurement date. For the U.S. plans, the timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched with an interest rate curve applicable to the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment
period to determine an overall effective discount rate. In making this 
  39 


Table of Contents

determination, the Company considers the yields on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve, the general movement of interest rates, and the
changes in those rates from one period to the next. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in
lower pension expense. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $23 per year.  The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return
on plan assets assumption is based on an estimated weighted average of long-term returns of major asset classes. In determining asset class returns, the Company takes into account long-term returns of major asset classes, historical performance of
plan assets, and related value of active management, as well as the current interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined by an asset/liability study that takes into account plan demographics, asset returns, and acceptable levels of
risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $14 per year. 
The Company uses a market-related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses. Investment gains or losses are the
difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets. This method recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility.
Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period.  The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. The Company determines this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and
historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $12 per year. 
Loss Contingencies  In the normal course of business the Company encounters contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the Company. The Company accrues a liability for loss
contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount
within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. 
Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which the Company’s accounting policy is
discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both
determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, the
Company reassesses probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss
contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is
increased, or the Company’s proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on the Company’s net income in the period in which it
is recorded.  NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE 
See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the Company’s
implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, plans, estimates and expectations regarding future operations, financial performance, costs and capital expenditures, projects, and applications and technologies. These
forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date this Report is filed regarding important risk factors. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections
and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, the Company’s acquisition of Airgas Inc. pursuant to the Company’s pending tender offer;
slowing of global economic recovery; renewed deterioration in economic and business conditions; weakening demand for the Company’s products; future financial and operating performance of major customers and industries served by the Company;
unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; asset impairments due to economic conditions or specific product or customer events; the success of commercial negotiations; the impact of
competitive products and pricing; interruption in ordinary sources of supply of raw materials; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory activities;
successful development and market acceptance of new products and applications; the ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel in all regions of the world where the Company operates; consequences of acts of war or terrorism; the effects
of a natural disaster; the success of cost reduction and productivity programs; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures, including achieving anticipated acquisition synergies; significant fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the continued availability of capital funding sources in all of the Company’s foreign operations; the impact of environmental, healthcare, tax or other legislation and
regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; the impact of new or changed financial accounting guidance; the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized; and other risk factors described in Section 1A.
The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company’s assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change
in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based.   


 
ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  The Company’s earnings, cash flows, and financial position are
exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is the Company’s policy to minimize its cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial
risks inherent in funding with debt capital.  The Company mitigates adverse energy price impacts through its cost
pass-through contracts with customers, as well as price increases. The Company has also entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain
oil-based feedstocks. There were no commodity swap contracts outstanding at 30 September 2010.  The Company
addresses these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk
of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial
Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  The Company’s derivative and
other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange-forward contracts, foreign exchange-option contracts, and commodity swaps. The net market
value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position. The net financial instrument position does not include available-for-sale securities of $103.6 at 30 September 2010 and $19.4 at
30 September 2009 as disclosed in Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. The available-for-sale securities in 2010 primarily included the investment in Airgas stock of $102.5. 
At 30 September 2010 and 2009, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $4,086 and $4,510, respectively. The
decrease in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to a reduction in long-term debt and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the translation of foreign currency long-term debt. 
The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Company’s financial instruments to selected changes in
market rates and prices. The range of changes chosen reflects the Company’s view of changes that are 
  41 


Table of Contents

reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate
risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by the Company using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward
exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date.  Interest Rate Risk 
The Company’s debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of 30 September 2010 primarily comprised debt denominated in
Euros (42%) and U.S. dollars (44%), including the effect of currency swaps. This debt portfolio is composed of 48% fixed-rate debt and 52% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate
portions of the Company’s debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on
the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position.  The sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the Company’s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2010, with all other
variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $87 and $92 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively. A 100 basis point
decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $95 and $92 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Based on the variable-rate debt included in the Company’s debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100
basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional $22 and $20 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively. A 100 basis point decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by
$22 and $20 per year at 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
 The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their
levels at 30 September 2010 and 2009, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $345 and
$369 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The
primary currencies for which the Company has exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the U.S. dollar versus the Pound Sterling. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts
are used in countries where the Company does business, thereby reducing its net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts are also used to hedge the Company’s firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows, along with foreign
exchange-option contracts. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite
direction and materially equal (or more favorable in the case of purchased foreign exchange-option contracts) to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
  MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING  Air Products’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting, which is defined in the following sentences, is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:   


 
(i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
 


 
(ii)
provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
 


 
(iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting can only provide reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our processes contain
self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.  Management has
evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
evaluation, management concluded that, as of 30 September 2010, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.  KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued their opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of 30 September 2010 as stated in their report which
appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.: 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as
of 30 September 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated income statements and consolidated statements of equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended 30 September 2010. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule referred to in item 15(a)(2) in this Form 10-K. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of 30 September 2010,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of 30 September
2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended 30 September 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, Air Products and Chemicals,
Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 30 September 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  /s/ KPMG LLP

1.  Major Accounting Policies 
Consolidation Principles  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and those of its controlled subsidiaries (the Company or Air Products), which are generally majority owned.
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.  The Company consolidates all entities that it
controls. The general condition for control is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity. Control may also exist in arrangements where the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. An entity that will
absorb the majority of a variable interest entity’s expected losses or expected residual returns is considered a primary beneficiary of that entity. The Company has determined that it is not a primary beneficiary in any material variable
interest entity.  Estimates and Assumptions 
The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Revenue Recognition 
Revenue from product sales is recognized as risk and title to the product transfers to the customer (which generally occurs at the
time shipment is made), the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Sales returns and allowances are not a business practice in the industry. 
Revenues from equipment sale contracts are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, revenues
from the sale of major equipment, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchangers and large air separation units, are recognized primarily based on labor hours incurred to date compared with total

  51 


Table of Contents

estimated labor hours. Changes to total estimated labor hours and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period determined. 
Amounts billed for shipping and handling fees are classified as sales in the consolidated income statements. 
Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on
revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements. The Company records a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority. 
Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted
for as leases. In cases where operating lease treatment is necessary, there is no difference in revenue recognition over the life of the contract as compared to accounting for the contract as product sales. In cases where capital lease treatment is
necessary, the timing of revenue and expense recognition is impacted. Revenue and expense are recognized up front for the sale of equipment component of the contract as compared to revenue recognition over the life of the arrangement under contracts
not qualifying as capital leases. Additionally, a portion of the revenue representing interest income from the financing component of the lease receivable is reflected as sales over the life of the contract. 
If an arrangement involves multiple deliverables, the delivered items are considered separate units of accounting if the items have
value on a stand-alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of their fair values. Revenues from the arrangement are allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. 
Cost of Sales  Cost of sales predominantly represents the cost of tangible products sold. These costs include labor, raw materials, plant engineering, power, depreciation, production supplies and materials packaging costs, and
maintenance costs. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are also included in cost of sales.  Depreciation
 Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from
earnings every year over its expected economic useful life. The principal lives for major classes of plant and equipment are summarized in the table below:

 The depreciable lives for various types of distribution equipment are 10 to 25 years for cylinders, depending on the nature and properties of the product;
20 years for tanks; 7.5 years for customer stations; 5 to 15 years for tractors and trailers. 
  Selling and Administrative 
The principal components of selling and administrative expenses are salaries, advertising, and promotional costs. 
Postemployment Benefits  The Company has substantive ongoing severance arrangements. Termination benefits provided to employees as part of the global cost reduction plan (discussed in Note 5, Global Cost Reduction Plan) are consistent with
termination benefits in previous, similar arrangements. Because the Company’s plan met the definition of an ongoing benefit arrangement, a liability was recognized for termination benefits when probable and estimable. These criteria are met
when management, with the appropriate level of authority, approves and commits to its plan of action for termination; the plan identifies the employees to be terminated and their related benefits; and the plan is to be completed within one year.
During periods of operations where terminations are made on an as-needed basis, absent a detailed committed plan, terminations are accounted for on an individual basis and a liability is recognized when probable and estimable.

Table of Contents
Financial Instruments 
The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of
derivative financial instruments. Refer to Note 13, Financial Instruments, for further detail on the types and use of derivative instruments that the Company enters into. The types of derivative financial instruments permitted for such risk
management programs are specified in policies set by management.  Major financial institutions are counterparties to all
of these derivative contracts. The Company has established counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better. Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit
risk is remote, and any losses would be immaterial to the consolidated financial results, financial condition, or liquidity.  The Company recognizes these derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, the Company generally designates the derivative as either (1) a hedge of a
forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge), (2) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), or (3) a hedge
of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge).  The
following details the accounting treatment of the Company’s cash flow, fair value, net investment, and non-designated hedges:   


 
•
 
 Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and then recognized in earnings when the hedged items affect earnings. 
   


 
•
 
 Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the
hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings. 
   


 
•
 
 Changes in the fair value of a derivative and foreign currency debt that are designated as and meet all the required criteria for a hedge of a net investment are
recorded as translation adjustments in AOCI. 
   


 
•
 
 Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in earnings. 
  The Company formally documents the relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and
liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that
derivative prospectively.  Foreign Currency 
Since the Company does business in many foreign countries, fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the Company’s
financial position and results of operations.  In most of the Company’s foreign operations, local currency is
considered the functional currency. Generally, foreign subsidiaries translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates—that is, the rates in effect at the end of the fiscal period. The gains or losses that result
from this process are shown in AOCI in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet.  The revenue and expense
accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates that prevailed during the period. Therefore, the U.S. dollar value of these items on the consolidated income statement fluctuates from period to period,
depending on the value of the dollar against foreign currencies. Some transactions are made in currencies different from an entity’s functional currency. Gains and losses from these foreign currency transactions are generally included in
earnings as they occur.  Environmental Expenditures 
Accruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
loss can be reasonably estimated. Remediation costs are capitalized if the costs improve the Company’s property as compared with the condition of the property when originally constructed or acquired, or if the costs prevent environmental
contamination from future operations. The Company expenses environmental costs 
  53 


Table of Contents

related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible. 
The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on an evaluation of currently available information with respect to each
individual site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. An environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include,
for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures, post-remediation monitoring costs, and outside
legal fees. These liabilities include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that the Company has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. They do not take into account any claims for
recoveries from insurance or other parties and are not discounted.  As assessments and remediation progress at individual
sites, the amount of projected cost is reviewed periodically, and the liability is adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Management has a well-established process in place to identify and monitor the
Company’s environmental exposures. An environmental accrual analysis is prepared and maintained that lists all environmental loss contingencies, even where an accrual has not been established. This analysis assists in monitoring the
Company’s overall environmental exposure and serves as a tool to facilitate ongoing communication among the Company’s technical experts, environmental managers, environmental lawyers, and financial management to ensure that required
accruals are recorded and potential exposures disclosed.  Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future
periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information on the Company’s environmental loss contingencies. 
The accruals for environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily as part of other noncurrent
liabilities, and will be paid over a period of up to 30 years.  Litigation 
In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in legal proceedings. The Company accrues a liability for such matters
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better
estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency includes estimates of potential damages and other directly related costs expected to be incurred. 
Share-Based Compensation  The Company has various share-based compensation programs, which include stock options, deferred stock units, and restricted stock. Refer to Note 19, Share-Based Compensation, for further detail. The Company
expenses the grant-date fair value of these awards over the vesting period during which employees perform related services.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A principal temporary difference
results from the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation because accelerated methods of depreciation and shorter useful lives are used for income tax purposes. The cumulative impact of a change in tax rates or regulations is included in
income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.  A tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is
recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. This position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.  Cash and Cash
Items  Cash and cash items include cash, time deposits, and certificates of deposit acquired with an original
maturity of three months or less.

Trade Receivables, Less Allowances for Doubtful Accounts 
Trade receivables primarily comprise amounts owed to the Company through its operating activities and are presented net of
allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations. A provision for customer defaults is made on a general
formula basis when it is determined that the risk of some default is probable and estimable but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length
of time the receivables are past due, historical experience, and existing economic conditions. The allowances also include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified considering factors such as the
financial condition of the customer and customer disputes over contractual terms and conditions. Provisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts charged against income were $29.5, $37.8, and $14.4 in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
 Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
 The Company utilizes the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for determining the cost of inventories in the Merchant
Gases, Tonnage Gases, and Electronics and Performance Materials segments in the United States. Inventories for these segments outside of the United States are accounted for on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, as the LIFO method is not
generally permitted in the foreign jurisdictions where these segments operate. The inventories of the Equipment and Energy segment on a worldwide basis, as well as all other inventories, are accounted for on the FIFO basis. 
At the business segment level, inventories are recorded at FIFO and the LIFO pool adjustments are not allocated to the business
segments.  Equity Investments 
The equity method of accounting is used when the Company has a 20% or greater interest in other companies and exercises significant
influence but does not have operating control. Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by the Company’s share of undistributed earnings or losses of these companies. Equity investments are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.  Plant and Equipment  Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Construction costs, labor, and applicable overhead related to installations are capitalized. Expenditures for additions and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are capitalized. The costs of
maintenance and repairs of plant and equipment are charged to expense as incurred.  Fully depreciated assets are retained
in the gross plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until they are removed from service. In the case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal,
are included in income.  Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash includes the proceeds from the issuance of certain industrial revenue bonds that must be held in escrow until
related project spending occurs. Restricted cash is classified as noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
Capitalized Interest  As the Company builds new plant and equipment, it includes in the cost of these assets a portion of the interest payments it makes during the year. The amount of capitalized interest was $14.3, $21.9, and $22.1 in
2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  Asset Retirement Obligations 
The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The liability
is measured at discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset
and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. The Company’s asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with Tonnage Gases on-site long-term supply contracts, under which the Company has built a facility on land leased from the
customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The Company’s asset retirement obligations totaled $57.6 and $43.5 at 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Computer Software 
The Company capitalizes costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use. Capitalized costs include purchased
computer software packages, payments to vendors/consultants for development and implementation or modification to a purchased package to meet Company requirements, payroll and related costs for employees directly involved in development, and
interest incurred while software is being developed. Capitalized computer software costs are included in the balance sheet classification plant and equipment and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software, generally a period of three
to ten years. The Company’s SAP system is being depreciated over a ten-year life.  Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets  Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If an asset is considered
impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to
sell.  Goodwill  Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values. Any excess purchase price
over the fair market value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. Preliminary purchase price allocations are made at the date of acquisition and finalized when information needed to affirm underlying
estimates is obtained, within a maximum allocation period of one year.  Goodwill is subject to impairment testing at
least annually. In addition, goodwill is tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. 
Intangible Assets  Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily consist of customer relationships and purchased patents and technology. The Company has no acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives. The cost of
intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of economic benefit. No residual value is estimated for these intangible assets. 
Customer relationships are generally amortized over periods of five to twenty-five years. Purchased patents and technology and other
intangibles are amortized based on contractual terms, ranging generally from five to twenty years. Amortizable lives are adjusted whenever there is a change in the estimated period of economic benefit. 
Retirement Benefits  The cost of retiree benefits is recognized over the employees’ service period. The Company is required to use actuarial methods and assumptions in the valuation of defined benefit obligations and the
determination of expense. Differences between actual and expected results or changes in the value of obligations and plan assets are not recognized in earnings as they occur but, rather, systematically and gradually over subsequent periods. Refer to
Note 16, Retirement Benefits, for disclosures related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefits. 
2.  New Accounting Guidance 
New Accounting Guidance to be Implemented 
CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
 In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance that amends previous
guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE). It requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the Company’s variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. A company
would be required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a VIE operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s
economic performance. In addition, ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE are required. This guidance is effective for the Company for fiscal year 2011. The adoption of this guidance will not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
  56 


Table of Contents
MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE
ARRANGEMENTS  In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements. This new guidance amends the existing criteria for separating consideration received in multiple-deliverable arrangements and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables
based on their relative selling price. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable which is based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence, or management estimates. Expanded disclosures
related to multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements are also required. This guidance is effective for the Company for fiscal year 2011. Upon adoption, the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or
materially modified arrangements, or it may be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
Accounting Guidance Implemented  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  In December 2007, the
FASB issued authoritative guidance to affirm that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. This
guidance defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control. Among other requirements, the guidance
requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize at full fair value all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. If a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously-held ownership interest is
adjusted to fair value at the acquisition date, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in earnings. Contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date, and restructuring and acquisition-related costs are expensed as
incurred. The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, including uncertain tax positions, can be adjusted during the measurement period. Any adjustments after the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year, will be recognized in
earnings. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on 1 October 2009 and was applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s 2010 consolidated financial statements.
 NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that establishes the accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It requires entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheets. It also requires disclosure,
on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interests. Changes in a parent’s ownership interests while the parent retains control are treated as
equity transactions. If a parent loses control of a subsidiary, any retained noncontrolling interests would be measured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. This guidance was effective for the Company on 1 October 2009
and was applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements related to noncontrolling interests, which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been
updated to reflect the new presentation.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
 In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Effective 1 October 2008, the Company adopted this guidance for financial assets and liabilities and any other assets and liabilities that are recognized and disclosed
at fair value on a recurring basis. The requirement for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities was effective on 1 October 2009 for the Company. This guidance did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon
adoption.  In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on improving disclosures about fair value
measurements. This guidance requires new disclosures about transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 measurements and separate disclosures about activity relating to Level 3 measurements. In addition, this guidance clarifies existing fair value
disclosures about the level of disaggregation and the input and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The guidance only relates to disclosure and does not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted
this guidance in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. There was no significant impact to the Company’s disclosures upon adoption. 
  57 


Table of Contents
EMPLOYERS’ DISCLOSURES ABOUT
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS  In December 2008, the
FASB issued authoritative guidance to require employers to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit or other postretirement plan. Disclosures include information about investment policies and strategies, major categories
of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, and significant concentrations of risk. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning with its fiscal year-end 2010. Upon adoption, this
guidance was not required to be applied to earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. This guidance only requires additional disclosure and did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon
adoption. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, for the required disclosures. 
3.  Airgas Transaction 
In February 2010, the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas),
including the associated preferred stock purchase rights, for $60.00 per share in cash, less any required withholding tax, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated 11 February 2010, as amended. Airgas, a
Delaware company, is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical, and specialty gases, and hard goods. On 6 September 2010, the Company increased the value of its tender offer to $65.50 per share. At this price, the total value of the
transaction would be approximately $7.4 billion, including $5.7 billion of equity and $1.7 billion of assumed debt. The offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire on 3 December 2010, unless further extended. 
At the Airgas’ Annual Meeting of Shareholders on 15 September 2010, Airgas shareholders elected three directors nominated
by Air Products and also voted in favor of Air Products’ three by-law amendment proposals. Following the Annual Meeting, Airgas filed suit in the Delaware Chancery Court to invalidate the by-law amendment that would move Airgas’ next
annual meeting to January 2011. On 8 October 2010, the Delaware Chancery Court ruled that the by-law amendment was properly adopted at the Airgas Annual Meeting on 15 September 2010 and that it is valid under Delaware law. Airgas has
appealed the Court’s ruling.  Further, in October 2010, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission approved the terms of a
Consent Decree for the proposed acquisition of Airgas. The Consent Decree would permit the Company to acquire Airgas subject to the divestiture of certain assets within a period of time after the closing of the acquisition. The assets to be divested
relate primarily to Airgas’ liquid bulk and on-site supply of atmospheric gases, including production and related assets.  Prior to the tender offer, the Company purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for $69.6. This amount was recorded as an available-for-sale investment within other noncurrent assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended 30 September 2010, an after-tax unrealized holding gain of $20.6 was recorded in other comprehensive income within total equity on the consolidated balance sheet. 
In connection with this tender offer, the Company has secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit
facility. Refer to Note 15, Debt, for additional information on this credit facility.  For the year ended
30 September 2010, $96.0 ($60.1 after-tax, or $.28 per share) in expense was recognized related to this transaction and is included within acquisition-related costs on the consolidated income statement. This includes amortization of the fees
related to the term loan credit facility and other acquisition-related costs. Total costs of this transaction are expected to be approximately $150 to $200.  4.  Business Combinations  In the second
quarter of 2010, the Company entered into agreements that will enable it to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of the French SAGA group (SAGA), which consists of SAGA, SAGA Medical, and SAGA Technologies. SAGA is an independent industrial gas
provider in France with packaged gases, liquid bulk, and medical businesses. The acquisition of SAGA supports the Merchant Gases segment’s integration strategy by enhancing market position in southwest and central France. SAGA revenues for
calendar year 2009 were approximately €25, or $35. 
Under the terms of these agreements, the Company purchased 51.47% of the shares of SAGA on 1 March 2010 for €34.5 or $47.2 ($25.0 net of cash acquired of $22.2). The remaining shares are expected to be purchased by the end of calendar year 2010 for a
fixed price of €44.8, or approximately $61, under a put and call option structure. At 30 September 2010, this structure was accounted
for as a financing of the purchase of the remaining shares and reported within short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet. 
  58 


Table of Contents
The acquisition of SAGA was accounted for as a business combination, and its results
of operations were included in the Company’s consolidated income statement after the acquisition date. The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition
date, with the amount exceeding the fair value recorded as goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation with no material adjustments made to the preliminary valuation. The final purchase price
allocation included identified intangibles of $42.5, plant and equipment of $40.8, goodwill of $35.0 (which is deductible for tax purposes), and other net assets of $12.7. Additionally, deferred tax liabilities of $23.0 were recognized. The
identified intangibles primarily relate to customer relationships and are being amortized over 23 years.  Goodwill, which
was assigned to the Merchant Gases segment, largely consisted of expected revenue and cost synergies resulting from the business combination. Revenue synergies will result primarily from the sale of differentiated offerings and cost synergies from
combining supply chains and optimization of the combined logistics. The fair value of plant and equipment was quantified primarily using a cost approach, by estimating reproduction/replacement cost consistent with assumptions market participants
would use. Intangible assets consisted primarily of customer relationships for which fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis under the income approach. The income approach required estimating a number of factors, including
projected revenue growth, customer attrition rates, profit margin, and the discount rate. The remaining identifiable assets and liabilities were primarily cash, accounts receivable, and payables and accrued liabilities, for which book value
approximated fair value.  Prior Year Acquisitions 
Acquisitions in 2009, totaling $32.7, included principally the purchase of S.I.Q. — Beteiligungs GmbH, a manufacturer
of epoxy additives. In 2008, acquisitions totaled $72.0 and included the purchase of an additional interest in CryoService Limited, a cryogenic and specialty gases company in the U.K. See Note 20, Noncontrolling Interests, for a discussion on a
related put option agreement.  5.  Global Cost Reduction Plan 
2009 Plan  The 2009 results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after-tax, or $.94 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company announced the global
cost reduction plan designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. The 2009 first-quarter results included a charge of $174.2 ($116.1 after-tax, or $.55 per
share). In the third quarter 2009, due to the continuing slow economic recovery, the Company committed to additional actions associated with its global cost reduction plan that resulted in a charge of $124.0 ($84.2 after-tax, or $.39 per share).
 The total 2009 charge included $210.0 for severance and other benefits, including pension-related costs, associated with
the elimination of approximately 2,550 positions from the Company’s global workforce. The reductions were targeted at reducing overhead and infrastructure costs, reducing and refocusing elements of the Company’s technology and business
development spending, lowering its plant operating costs, and the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. The remainder of this charge, $88.2, was for business exits and asset management actions. Assets held for sale were written down to net
realizable value, and an environmental liability of $16.0 was recognized. This environmental liability resulted from a decision to sell a production facility.  Business Segments  The global cost reduction plan charge recorded in 2009 was
excluded from segment operating profit. The table below displays how this charge related to the businesses at the segment level:

During 2010, the Company revised its estimate of the costs associated with the 2009
global cost reduction plan. The unfavorable impact of additional severance and other benefits was primarily offset by favorable variances related to completed business exits and asset management actions. These adjustments to the charge were excluded
from segment operating profit and did not have a material impact on any individual segment.  As of 30 September
2010, the planned actions associated with the global cost reduction plan were substantially completed with the exception of certain benefit payments associated with a small number of position eliminations. In addition, as part of the asset
management actions included in the plan, the Company anticipates completing the sale of a facility by the end of calendar year 2010.  Accrual Balance  The following table summarizes changes to the carrying amount

  6. Discontinued Operations 
The U.S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for
as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are
segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.  U.S. Healthcare 
In 2007, the Company implemented several changes to improve performance in its U.S. Healthcare business, including management
changes, product and service offering simplification, and other measures. However, market and competitive conditions were more challenging than anticipated and financial results did not meet expectations. In response to the disappointing financial
results, during the third quarter of 2008, management conducted an evaluation of the strategic alternatives for the business. In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of this business. Accordingly, beginning
in the fourth quarter of 2008, the U.S. Healthcare business was accounted for as discontinued operations.  In 2008, the
Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after-tax, or $1.12 per share) related to the impairment/write-down of the net carrying value of this business as follows: 
 


 
•
 
 In the third quarter of 2008, the Company determined that an interim test for goodwill impairment and other long-lived assets was required for its U.S.
Healthcare reporting unit. The Company reforecast its cash flows and utilized the expected present value of the future cash flows to calculate fair value of the U.S. Healthcare reporting unit in completing its impairment test. A charge of $314.8
($237.0 after-tax, or $1.09 per share) consisted of the impairment of goodwill for $294.3, intangible assets for $11.7, plant and equipment for $7.8, and other assets for $1.0. The impairment reduced the carrying amount of the U.S. Healthcare
reporting unit goodwill and intangible assets to zero.

•
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a charge of $14.4 ($9.2 after-tax, or $.04 per share), reflecting an estimate of net realizable value.

  In the first quarter of 2009, based on additional facts, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share), reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the U.S. Healthcare business. Also, a tax benefit of $8.8, or $.04 per share, was recorded to revise the
estimated tax benefit related to previously recognized impairment charges.  As a result of events that occurred during
the second quarter of 2009, which increased the Company’s ability to realize tax benefits associated with the impairment charges recorded in 2008, the Company recognized a one-time tax benefit of $16.7, or $.08 per share. 
During the third quarter of 2009, the Company sold more than half of its remaining U.S. Healthcare business to OptionCare
Enterprises, Inc., a subsidiary of Walgreen Co., and Landauer-Metropolitan, Inc. (LMI) for combined cash proceeds of $38.1. The Company recognized an after-tax gain of $.3 resulting from these sales combined with adjustments to the net realizable
value of the remaining businesses.  During the fourth quarter of 2009, through a series of transactions with Rotech
Healthcare, Inc. and with LMI, the Company sold its remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $12.1. A net after-tax loss of $.7 was recognized. These transactions completed the disposal of the U.S. Healthcare business.

the U.S. Healthcare divestiture at 30 September 2010 are not material and have been classified in continuing operations.  Polymer Emulsions Business  On 31 January 2008, the Company closed on
the sale of its interest in its vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE) polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. As part of that agreement, the Company received Wacker Chemie AG’s interest in the Elkton, Md.
and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and their related businesses plus cash proceeds of $258.2. The Company recognized a gain of $89.5 ($57.7 after-tax, or $.26 per share) in the second quarter of 2008 for this sale, which consisted of the
global VAE polymers operations, including production facilities located in Calvert City, Ky.; South Brunswick, N.J.; Cologne, Germany; and Ulsan, Korea; and commercial and research capabilities in Allentown, Pa. and Burghausen, Germany. The business
produces VAE for use in adhesives, paints and coatings, paper, and carpet applications.  On 30 June 2008, the
Company sold its Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses to Ashland, Inc. for $92.0. The Company recorded a gain of $30.5 ($18.5
after-tax, or $.08 per share) in connection with the sale, which included the recording of a retained environmental obligation of $24.0 ($14.5 after-tax, or $.07 per share) associated with the Piedmont site. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and
Contingencies, for additional information on this charge. The sale of the Elkton and Piedmont facilities completed the disposal of the Company’s Polymer Emulsions business.

   Inventories valued using the LIFO method comprised 40.5% of consolidated inventories before LIFO adjustment at both 30 September 2010 and 2009. Liquidation of LIFO inventory layers in 2010 and 2008 did
not materially affect results of operations in those years. During 2009, there was no liquidation of prior years’ LIFO inventory layers.  FIFO cost approximates replacement cost. The Company’s inventories have a high turnover, and as a result, there is little difference between the original cost of an item and its current replacement cost.

   Acquisitions and adjustments related to the Merchant Gases segment in 2010 included $35.0 associated with the SAGA acquisition, offset by a reduction in goodwill for an adjustment related to a previous acquisition
of $16.9. Refer to Note 4, Business Combinations, for further detail on the SAGA acquisition.  In the fourth quarter
of 2010, the Company conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment. The Company determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of
impairment.

   13.  Financial Instruments  Currency
Price Risk Management  The Company’s earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to foreign
currency risk from foreign currency denominated transactions and net investments in foreign operations. It is the policy of the Company to minimize its cash flow volatility to changes in currency exchange rates. This is accomplished by identifying
and evaluating the risk that the Company’s cash flows will change in value due to changes in exchange rates and by executing the appropriate strategies necessary to manage such exposures. The Company’s objective is to maintain economically
balanced currency risk management strategies that provide adequate downside protection.  Forward Exchange Contracts
 The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the cash flow exposure to foreign currency fluctuations
associated with highly anticipated cash flows and certain firm commitments such as the purchase of plant and equipment. Forward exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates by
creating a liability in a currency in which the Company has a net equity position. The primary currency pair in this portfolio of forward contracts is the Euro/U.S. Dollar. 
In addition to the foreign exchange contracts that are designated as hedges, the Company also hedges foreign currency exposures
utilizing forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges. These contracts are used to hedge foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily working capital. The primary objective of these forward contracts is to
protect the value of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their receipt or settlement. This portfolio of forward exchange contracts comprise
many different foreign currency pairs, with a profile that changes from time to time depending on business activity and sourcing decisions.  Option Contracts  In certain limited situations, the Company enters into option
contracts to manage cash flow exposures to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to forward contracts, these instruments are evaluated for hedge accounting treatment and are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. As of
30 September 2010 and 2009, there were no outstanding option contracts.

   In addition to the above, the Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and qualifying intercompany loans to hedge the foreign currency exposures of the Company’s net investment in certain foreign
affiliates. The designated foreign currency denominated debt at 30 September 2010 includes €782.1 and NT$967.0, and at
30 September 2009 includes €1,013.0 and NT$965.0. The designated intercompany loans include €437.0 at both 30 September 2010 and 2009.  Debt Portfolio Management  It is the policy of the Company to identify on a
continuing basis the need for debt capital and evaluate the financial risks inherent in funding the Company with debt capital. Reflecting the result of this ongoing review, the debt portfolio and hedging program of the Company are managed with the
objectives and intent to (1) reduce funding risk with respect to borrowings made by the Company to preserve the Company’s access to debt capital and provide debt capital as required for funding and liquidity purposes, and (2) manage
the aggregate interest rate risk and the debt portfolio in accordance with certain debt management parameters. 
Interest Rate Swap Contracts  The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to change the fixed/variable interest rate mix of its debt portfolio in order to maintain the percentage of fixed- and variable-rate debt within the parameters
set by management. In accordance with these parameters, the agreements are used to optimize interest rate risks and costs inherent in the Company’s debt portfolio. The current interest rate swap portfolio consists of fixed-to-floating swaps
denominated in U.S. dollars and in Euros. In addition, the Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate on anticipated fixed-rate debt issuance. The notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements are equal to or less
than the designated debt instrument being hedged. When interest rate swaps are used, the indices of the swap instruments and the debt to which they are designated are the same. It is the Company’s policy not to enter into any interest rate swap
contracts which lever a move in interest rates on a greater than one-to-one basis.  Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap
Contracts  The Company enters into cross currency interest rate swap contracts when the Company deems necessary.
These contracts may entail both the exchange of fixed- and floating-rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement and the exchange of one currency for another currency at inception and at a specified future date. These contracts
effectively convert the currency denomination of a debt instrument into another currency in which the Company has a net equity position while changing the interest rate characteristics of the instrument. The contracts are used to hedge long-term
intercompany and third-party borrowing transactions and certain net investments in foreign operations. The current cross currency swap portfolio consists of a single fixed-to-fixed swap between U.S. dollars and British Pound Sterling.

   Commodity Price Risk Management  The Company has entered into a limited number
of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oil-based feedstocks. As of 30 September 2010, the Company did not have outstanding commodity swap contracts. At
30 September 2009, the Company had outstanding energy contracts with a notional value of $18.5 and an average maturity of .2 years.

  Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
Certain derivative instruments are executed under agreements that require the Company to maintain a minimum credit rating opinion
from a third party. If the Company’s credit rating falls below this threshold, the counterparty to the derivative instruments has the right to request full collateralization on the derivatives’ net liability position. The net liability
position of derivatives with credit risk-related contingent features was $4.2 as of 30 September 2010 and $35.0 as of 30 September 2009. Because the Company’s current credit rating is above the various pre-established thresholds,
no collateral has been posted on these liability positions.  Counterparty Credit Risk Management 
The Company executes all derivative transactions with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions, all of which are
investment grade at this time. Some of the Company’s underlying derivative agreements give the Company the right to require the institution to post collateral if its credit rating falls below the pre-established thresholds. These are the same
agreements referenced in Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features above. The collateral that the counterparties would be required to post was $52.2 as of 30 September 2010 and $14.7 as of 30 September 2009. No financial institution is
required to post collateral at this time, as all have credit ratings at or above the threshold.  
14.  Fair Value Measurements  Fair value is defined as an exit price (i.e., the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date). The methods and assumptions used to measure the fair value of financial instruments are as follows: 
Derivatives  The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts are quantified using the income approach and are based on estimates using standard pricing models. These models take
into account the value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the time to maturity and currency of the underlying instruments. The computation of the fair values of
these instruments is generally performed by the Company. These standard pricing models utilize inputs which are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. In
addition, on an ongoing basis, the Company randomly tests a subset of its valuations against 
  69

valuations received from the transaction’s counterparty to validate the accuracy of its standard pricing models. The fair value of commodity swaps is based on current market price as
provided by the financial institutions with which the commodity swaps have been executed. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions. 
Refer to Note 13, Financial Instruments, for a description of derivative instruments, including details on the balance sheet line
classifications.  Available-for-Sale Securities 
The fair value of available-for-sale securities is based on a market approach, specifically quoted market prices in publicly traded
companies from the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and Tokyo Stock Exchange. These investments are reported within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet, with holding gains and losses recorded to OCI, net of tax. 
The available-for-sale securities primarily include the investment in Airgas stock of $102.5. At 30 September 2010, the change
in unrealized appreciation of this investment carried at fair value was $32.9 ($20.6 after-tax). Refer to Note 3, Airgas Transaction, for further detail.  Other investments primarily included an investment in a publicly traded foreign company. In July 2010, the Company donated 92% of this investment to a tax-exempt charitable organization and sold 8% of its
investment for cash. The carrying value of this investment at the time of the transactions was $17.2. The Company will deduct the fair value of the donation in its fiscal 2010 income tax returns. As a result of the donation, the Company recognized a
tax benefit of $5.8 in the fourth quarter of 2010. The combined donation and sale had an immaterial impact on operating income.  Long-term Debt  The fair value of the Company’s debt is based on estimates
using standard pricing models that take into account the value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the time to maturity and currency of the underlying instruments.
These standard valuation models utilize observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot rates. The computation of the fair value of these instruments is generally performed by the Company. 
The carrying values and fair values of financial instruments were as follows:

   The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash items, trade receivables, payables and accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes, and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these instruments. Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the above table.

The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:  Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2—Inputs that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Level 3—Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability based on the Company’s own assumptions (about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability). 
The following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance
sheets:

   Maturities of long-term debt in each of the next five years and beyond are as follows: $182.5 in 2011, $452.8 in 2012, $334.7 in 2013, $488.3 in 2014, $444.3 in 2015, and $1,939.7 thereafter. 
During 2010, the Company issued Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling $85.0, the proceeds of which must be held in escrow until related
project spending occurs. As of 30 September 2010, proceeds of $51.2 were held in escrow and classified as a noncurrent asset.  In February 2010, the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all outstanding common stock of Airgas as further discussed in Note 3, Airgas Transaction. In connection with this tender offer, the Company has
secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. Borrowings under this credit facility will be available beginning on the date of the consummation of the tender offer, which must occur no later than
4 February 2011. All borrowings under this credit facility will mature on the date that is one year from the consummation of the tender offer. The credit facility agreement contains one financial covenant, a maximum leverage ratio, and other
affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on liens and certain subsidiary indebtedness. It also requires mandatory commitment reduction/prepayment for certain capital market transactions and asset dispositions. Fees incurred to
secure this credit facility have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the arrangement.  The Company has
obtained the commitment of a number of commercial banks to lend money at market rates whenever needed. At 30 September 2009, the Company’s total multicurrency committed credit facility amounted to $1,450.0. On 8 July 2010, the Company
replaced this facility with a new $2,000.0 multicurrency committed credit facility maturing on 8 July 2013. Facility fees were modified to reflect current market rates. The Company has one financial covenant associated with this new credit
facility. The covenant indicates that the ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) shall not exceed 3.0. This credit facility provides a 
  72

source of liquidity and is used to support the issuance of commercial paper. No borrowings were outstanding under this commitment at the end of 2010. Additional commitments totaling $518.7 are
maintained by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, of which $345.2 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2010.  Various debt agreements to which the Company is a party also include financial covenants and other restrictions, including restrictions pertaining to the ability to create property liens and enter into certain sale
and leaseback transactions. The Company is in compliance with all of its financial debt covenants.  
16.  Retirement Benefits  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension
plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants
in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. The principal defined contribution plan is the Retirement Savings Plan, in which a substantial portion of the U.S. employees participate; a similar plan is offered to U.K. employees. The
Company also provides other postretirement benefits consisting primarily of healthcare benefits to U.S. retirees who meet age and service requirements.  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  Pension benefits earned are generally based on
years of service and compensation during active employment. The cost of the Company’s defined benefit pension plans included the following components:

   The Company’s U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the participant’s retirement date. The
Company recognizes pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. The
Company recognized $11.5, $10.7, and $30.3 of settlement charges in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  Special
termination benefits for fiscal year 2010 included $2.8 for the global cost reduction plan. Special termination benefits for fiscal year 2009 included $28.5 for the global cost reduction plan. The global cost reduction charge for fiscal year 2009
also included $3.8 for curtailment losses related to the U.K. pension plans.

   The net actuarial loss represents the actual changes in the estimated obligation and plan assets that have not yet been recognized in the consolidated income statement and are included in AOCI. Actuarial losses
arising during 2010 and 2009 are primarily attributable to lower discount rates. In 2009, actual asset returns were also below expected returns. Actuarial gains and losses are not recognized immediately, but instead are accumulated as a part of the
unrecognized net loss balance and amortized into net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service period of participating employees as certain thresholds are met. 
The components recognized in AOCI on a pretax basis at 30 September consisted of:

   The assets of the Company’s defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. Except where the Company’s equity is a component of an index fund, the defined benefit
plans are prohibited by Company policy from holding shares of Company stock.  Asset allocation targets are established
based on the long-term return and volatility characteristics of the investment classes and recognize the benefit of diversification and the profiles of the plans’ liabilities. The actual and target allocations at the measurement date are as

   The descriptions and fair value methodologies for the U.S. and International pension plan assets are as follows:  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents
approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity.  Equity Securities 
Equity securities are valued at the closing market price reported on a U.S. exchange where the security is actively traded and are
therefore classified as Level 1 assets.  Mutual Funds 
Shares of mutual funds are valued at the net asset value (NAV) quoted on the exchange where the fund is traded and are classified as
Level 1 assets. NAV is used as a practical expedient for fair value. 
  76 


Table of Contents
Pooled Funds 
Units of pooled funds are valued at the per unit NAV determined by the fund manager and are classified as Level 2 assets. NAV is
used as a practical expedient for fair value.  Corporate and Government Bonds 
Corporate and government bonds are classified as Level 2 assets, as they are either valued at quoted market prices from observable
pricing sources at the reporting date or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields and credit ratings. 
Mortgage and Asset-Backed Securities  Securities are classified as Level 2 assets, as they are either valued at quoted market prices from observable pricing sources at the reporting date or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields,
credit ratings, and purpose of the underlying loan.  Real Estate Pooled Funds 
Funds are classified as Level 3 assets, as they are carried at the estimated fair value of the underlying properties. Estimated fair
value is calculated utilizing a combination of key inputs such as revenue and expense growth rates, terminal capitalization rates, and discount rates. These key inputs are consistent with practices prevailing within the real estate investment
management industry.  Other Pooled Funds 
Securities classified as Level 2 assets are valued at the NAV of the shares held at year end, which is based on the fair value of
the underlying investments. Securities and interests classified as Level 3 are carried at the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment values, which includes estimated bids from brokers
or other third-party vendor sources that utilize expected cash flow streams and other un-corroborated data, including counterparty credit quality, default risk, discount rates and the overall capital market liquidity. 
Insurance Contracts  Interests are classified as Level 3 assets, as they are carried at contract value, which approximates the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment of
the insurance company.  The Company employs a mix of active and passive investment strategies. Over a full market cycle,
the total return on plan assets is expected to exceed that of a passive strategy tracking index returns in each asset category.  The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on an estimated weighted average of long-term returns of major asset classes. In determining asset class returns, the Company takes into account long-term
returns of major asset classes, historical performance of plan assets, and related value of active management, as well as the current interest rate environment.  The Company anticipates contributing approximately $247 to the defined benefit pension plans in 2011.  Projected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are as follows:

The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee service rendered to
a particular date, based on current salaries. The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans was $3,327.6 and $2,970.8 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively.

 Defined Contribution Plans 
The Company maintains a nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) which forms part of the Air Products and Chemicals,
Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (RSP). The ESOP was established in May of 2002. The balance of the RSP is a qualified defined contribution plan including a 401(k) elective deferral component. A substantial portion of U.S. employees are eligible and
participate.  Dividends paid on ESOP shares are treated as ordinary dividends by the Company. Under existing tax law, the
Company may deduct dividends which are paid with respect to shares held by the plan. Shares of the Company’s common stock in the ESOP totaled 5,276,922 as of 30 September 2010. 
The Company matches a portion of the participants’ contributions to the RSP and other various worldwide defined contribution
plans. The Company’s contributions to the RSP include a Company core contribution for certain eligible employees who do not receive their primary retirement benefit from the defined benefit pension plans, with the core contribution based on a
percentage of pay that is dependent on years of service. For the RSP, the Company also makes matching contributions on overall employee contributions as a percentage of the employee contribution and includes an enhanced contribution for certain
eligible employees (not participating in the defined benefit pension plans). Worldwide contributions expensed to income in 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $30.8, $30.6, and $30.1, respectively. 
Other Postretirement Benefits  The Company provides other postretirement benefits consisting primarily of healthcare benefits to certain U.S. retirees who meet age and service requirements. The healthcare benefit is a continued medical benefit
until the retiree reaches age 65. Healthcare benefits are contributory, with contribution percentages adjusted periodically. The retiree medical costs are capped at a specified dollar amount, with the retiree contributing the remainder. 
The cost of the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans included the following components:

17.  Commitments and Contingencies
 Litigation  The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including competition, environmental, health, safety, product liability, and insurance matters. In September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for
Economic Defense (CADE) issued a decision against the Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R$179.2
on Air Products Brasil Ltda. This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases.
The fines are based on a percentage of the Company’s total revenue in Brazil in 2003.  The Company has denied the
allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 to the Brazilian courts. Certain of the Company’s defenses, if successful, could result in the matter being dismissed with no fine against the Company. The Company, with
advice of its outside legal counsel, has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is reasonably possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result, no provision has
been made in the consolidated financial statements.  The Company is required to provide security in order to suspend
execution of the judgment during the appeal process, during which time interest will accrue on the fine. The security could be in the form of a bank guarantee or in other forms which the courts deem acceptable. The security is only collectible by
the courts in the event the Company is not successful in its appeal and does not timely pay the fine. The form of security to be provided by the Company has not been finally determined. 
While the Company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in connection with this or any other legal proceeding would have
a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or net cash flows, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on the Company’s net income in the period in which it is recorded.
 Environmental  In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in legal proceedings under the federal Superfund law, similar state environmental laws, and RCRA relating to the designation of certain sites for
investigation or remediation. Presently, there are approximately 30 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the Company, along with others, has been designated a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection
Agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation. In addition, the Company is also involved in cleanup activities at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites. The Company continually monitors these sites for which it has
environmental exposure.  Accruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated consistent with the policy set forth in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2010 and 2009 included an accrual of $87.0 and
$95.0, respectively, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities. The environmental liabilities will be paid over a period of up to 30 years. The Company estimates the exposure for environmental loss contingencies to range from $87 to a
reasonably possible upper exposure of $101 as of 30 September 2010.  Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites
in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Using reasonably possible alternative assumptions of the exposure level could result in an increase to the environmental accrual. Due
to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to the reasonably possible upper exposure level could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation
alternative is identified, or a significant increase in the Company’s proportionate share occurs. The Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or
disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in any one year. 
PACE  At 30 September 2010, $36.5 of the environmental accrual was related to the Pace facility.  In 2006, the Company sold its Amines business, which included operations at Pace, Florida and recognized a liability for retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at Pace. The
Company is required by the 
  80 


Table of Contents

Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to continue its remediation efforts. The Company estimated that it
would take about 20 years to complete the groundwater remediation, and the costs through completion were estimated to range from $42 to $50. As no amount within the range was a better estimate than another, the Company recognized a pretax
expense in fiscal 2006 of $42.0 as a component of income from discontinued operations and recorded an environmental accrual of $42.0 in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets. There has been no change to the estimated exposure
range related to the Pace facility.  The Company has implemented many of the remedial corrective measures at the Pace,
Florida facility required under 1995 Consent Orders issued by the FDEP and the USEPA. Contaminated soils have been bioremediated, and the treated soils have been secured in a lined on-site disposal cell. Several groundwater recovery systems have
been installed to contain and remove contamination from groundwater. The Company completed an extensive assessment of the site to determine how well existing measures are working, what additional corrective measures may be needed, and whether newer
remediation technologies that were not available in the 1990s might be suitable to more quickly and effectively remove groundwater contaminants. Based on assessment results, the Company completed a focused feasibility study that identified new and
alternative approaches which should more effectively remove contaminants and achieve the targeted remediation goals. The Company is reviewing the new approaches with the FDEP. 
PIEDMONT  At 30 September 2010, $21.5 of the environmental accrual was related to the Piedmont site.  On 30 June 2008, the Company sold its Elkton, Maryland and Piedmont, South Carolina production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives
businesses. In connection with the sale, the Company recognized a liability for retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at the Piedmont site. This site is under active remediation for contamination caused by an
insolvent prior owner. The sale of the site triggered expense recognition. Prior to the sale, remediation costs had been capitalized since they improved the property as compared to its condition when originally acquired. The Company is required by
the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control to address both contaminated soil and groundwater. Numerous areas of soil contamination have been addressed, and contaminated groundwater is being recovered and treated. The Company
estimated that it would take until 2015 to complete source area remediation and another 15 years thereafter to complete groundwater recovery, with costs through completion estimated to be $24.0. The Company recognized a pretax expense in 2008
of $24.0 as a component of income from discontinued operations and recorded an environmental liability of $24.0 in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets. There has been no change to the estimated exposure. 
PAULSBORO  At 30 September 2010, $14.0 of the environmental accrual was related to the Paulsboro site.  During the first quarter of 2009, management committed to a plan to sell the production facility in Paulsboro, New Jersey and recognized a $16.0 environmental liability associated with this site. In December 2009,
the Company completed the sale of this facility. The Company is required by the New Jersey state law to investigate and, if contaminated, remediate a site upon its sale. The Company estimates that it will take at least several years to complete the
investigation/remediation efforts at this site.  Guarantees and Warranties 
The Company is a party to certain guarantee agreements, including debt guarantees of equity affiliates and equity support
agreements. These guarantees are contingent commitments that are related to activities of the Company’s primary businesses.  The Company has guaranteed repayment of some additional borrowings of certain unconsolidated equity affiliates. At 30 September 2010, these guarantees have terms in the range of two to eight years, with
maximum potential payments of $28.7.  The Company has entered into an equity support agreement and operations guarantee
related to an air separation facility constructed in Trinidad for a venture in which the Company owns 50%. At 30 September 2010, maximum potential payments under joint and several guarantees were $68.0. Exposures under the guarantee
decline over time and are completely extinguished by 2024.  To date, no equity contributions or payments have been
required since the inception of these guarantees. The fair value of the above guarantees is not material. 
  81 


Table of Contents
The Company, in the normal course of business operations, has issued product
warranties in its Equipment business. Also, contracts often contain standard terms and conditions which typically include a warranty and indemnification to the buyer that the goods and services purchased do not infringe on third-party intellectual
property rights. The provision for estimated future costs relating to warranties is not material to the consolidated financial statements.  The Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with guarantees and warranties will have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of
operations.  Put Option Agreements 
The Company has entered into put option agreements with certain affiliated companies as discussed below. The Company accounts for
the put options as contingent liabilities to purchase an asset. Since the inception of these agreements and through 30 September 2010, the Company determined that it was not certain that these options would be exercised by the other
shareholders.  In 2002, the Company entered into a put option agreement as part of the purchase of an additional interest
in San Fu Gas Company, Ltd., renamed Air Products San Fu Company, Ltd. (San Fu), an industrial gas company in Taiwan. Currently, the Company has an ownership interest of 74% in San Fu. Put options were issued which give other shareholders the right
to sell San Fu stock to the Company at market price when exercised. The options are effective through January 2015 and allow for the sale of all stock owned by other shareholders to the Company. The estimated U.S. dollar price of purchasing the
stock owned by other shareholders based on the exchange rate at 30 September 2010 would be approximately $240. 
In 1999, the Company made an investment in INOX, an Indian industrial gases company. As part of that transaction, put options were
issued which gave the other (joint 50%) shareholders the right to require the Company to purchase their shares (approximately 5.1 million) of INOX (renamed INOXAP) at a predefined price. The other shareholders may give notice to exercise the
put option between October and December 2010. The option, if exercised, would be effective on 31 July 2011. The option may also be exercised within six months of the death or permanent incapacity of the current Managing Director of INOXAP.
The option price is based on a multiple of earnings formula, but not less than 630 Rupees per share. The U.S. dollar price of purchasing all 5.1 million shares based on the multiple of earnings formula at the 30 September 2010 exchange
rate would be approximately $190.  Purchase Obligations 
The Company is obligated to make future payments under unconditional purchase obligations as summarized below:

   Most of the Company’s long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally
related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the
matching of most feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, the Company does not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
The above unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply commitments and also electric power and natural gas
supply purchase obligations. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $330 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2011.

18.  Capital Stock 
Authorized capital stock consists of 25 million preferred shares with a par value of $1 per share, none of which was
outstanding at 30 September 2010, and 300 million shares of common stock with a par value of $1 per share. 
In 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The
Company repurchases shares pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, through a 10b5-1 written repurchase plan established with several brokers. At 30 September 2010, $649.2 in share
repurchase authorization remained.  19.  Share-Based Compensation 
The Company has various share-based compensation programs, which include stock options, deferred stock units, and restricted stock.
Under all programs, the terms of the awards are fixed at the grant date. The Company issues shares from treasury stock upon the exercise of stock options, the payout of deferred stock units, and the issuance of restricted stock awards. As of
30 September 2010, there were 6,381,410 shares available for future grant under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan, which is shareholder approved.

   Stock Options  The Company has granted awards of options to purchase common
stock to executives, selected employees, and outside directors. The exercise price of stock options equals the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of the grant. Options generally vest incrementally over three years, and remain
exercisable for ten years from the date of grant. Options have not been issued to directors since 2005.  The fair value
of options granted was estimated using a lattice-based option valuation model that used the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility and expected dividend yield are based on actual historical experience of the Company’s stock
and dividends over the historical period equal to the option term. The expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on an analysis of Company-specific historical exercise data. The range given
below results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different behavior. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior were considered separately for valuation purposes. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
Strips with terms equal to the expected time of exercise as of the grant date.

   The aggregate intrinsic value represents the amount by which the Company’s closing stock price of $82.82 as of 30 September 2010 exceeds the exercise price multiplied by the number of in-the-money options
outstanding or exercisable as of that date.  The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2010, 2009, and
2008 was $92.4, $62.1, and $138.0, respectively.  Compensation cost is generally recognized over the stated vesting
period consistent with the terms of the arrangement (i.e., either on a straight-line or graded-vesting basis). Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would meet the requirements for vesting of awards upon their
retirement. As of 30 September 2010, there was $11.5 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years. 
Cash received from option exercises during 2010 was $88.1. The total tax benefit realized from stock option exercises in 2010 was
$33.7, of which $21.8 was the excess tax benefit.  Deferred Stock Units and Restricted Stock 
The grant-date fair value of deferred stock units and restricted stock is estimated on the date of grant based on the market price
of the stock, and compensation cost is generally amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period during which employees perform related services. Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would
meet the requirements for vesting of awards upon their retirement.  Deferred Stock Units 
The Company has granted deferred stock units to executives, selected employees, and outside directors. These deferred stock units
entitle the recipient to one share of common stock upon vesting, which is conditioned on continued employment during the deferral period and may also be conditioned on earn-out against certain performance targets. The deferral period for some units
ends after death, disability, or retirement. The deferral period for other performance-based deferred stock units ends at the end of the performance period (one to three years). Additionally, the Company has granted deferred stock units, subject to
a three-, four-, or five-year deferral period, to selected employees. Deferred stock units issued to directors are paid after service on the Board of Directors ends at the time elected by the director (not to exceed 10 years after service
ends).

Table of Contents
Cash payments made for deferred stock units were $1.4, $5.2, and $8.3 in 2010, 2009,
and 2008, respectively. As of 30 September 2010, there was $26.7 of unrecognized compensation cost related to deferred stock units. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years. The total fair value of
deferred stock units paid out during 2010, 2009, and 2008, including shares vested in prior periods, was $26.2, $22.1, and $51.5, respectively.  Restricted Stock  The Company has issued shares of restricted stock to certain
officers. Participants are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares. Shares granted prior to 2007 are subject to forfeiture if employment is terminated other than due to death, disability, or retirement. Shares granted since
2007 vest in four years or upon earlier retirement, death, or disability. The shares are nontransferable while subject to forfeiture.

   As of 30 September 2010, there was $1.8 of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.2 years. The
total fair value of restricted stock vested during 2010 and 2008 was $1.0 and $10.8, respectively. During 2009, no restricted stock vested.  20. Noncontrolling Interests  In 2008, the Company
entered into a put option agreement to purchase the remaining noncontrolling interest in CryoService Limited (CSL), a cryogenic and specialty gases company in the U.K. The Company increased its ownership at that time from 25% to 72%. Put options
were issued which gave the noncontrolling shareholders the right to require the Company to purchase their shares in CSL. The options were effective beginning January 2010 and are exercisable only within a 20-day option period each year. The option
price is based on a multiple of earnings formula.  In June 2010, the Company entered into agreements obligating it to
purchase 25% of the remaining shares of CSL. The agreements require the consideration, which is based on a multiple of earnings formula, to be remitted in January 2012. The share sale agreements effectively terminate the option agreements. The
carrying value of the 25% noncontrolling interest at the time the sale share agreements were entered into was $10.8. As a result of this arrangement, the Company reduced the noncontrolling interest for the 25% purchase obligation and recorded an
estimated liability based on the earnings formula. As the purchase of the noncontrolling interest does not result in a change of control, the difference between the carrying value of the 25% noncontrolling interest and the liability recognized has
been recorded as a $28.3 reduction in capital in excess of par value. At 30 September 2010, the liability amounted to $42.0 and has been reported in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

   Diluted EPS attributable to Air Products reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other share-based awards were exercised or converted into common stock. The dilutive effect is computed
using the treasury stock method, which assumes all share-based awards are exercised and the hypothetical proceeds from exercise are used by the Company to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The incremental shares
(difference between shares assumed to be issued versus purchased), to the extent they would have been dilutive, are included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation. Options on 2.2 million shares, 5.8 million shares, and
1.2 million shares were antidilutive and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  22.  Income Taxes  The following table shows

   Net current deferred tax assets of $124.1 and net noncurrent deferred tax assets of $85.5 were included in other receivables and current assets and other noncurrent assets at 30 September 2010,
respectively. Net current deferred tax assets of $206.6 and net noncurrent deferred tax assets of $71.5 were included in other receivables and current assets and other noncurrent assets at 30 September 2009, respectively. 
Foreign and state loss carryforwards as of 30 September 2010 were $161.3 and $306.3, respectively. The foreign losses have
expiration periods beginning in 2011. Some of the foreign operations operate in jurisdictions with unlimited carryforward periods. State operating loss carryforwards have expiration periods that range between 2011 and 2030. 
The valuation allowance as of 30 September 2010 primarily relates to the tax loss carryforwards referenced above. If events
warrant the reversal of the $55.4 valuation allowance, it would result in a reduction of tax expense. The Company believes it is more likely than not that future earnings will be sufficient to utilize the Company’s deferred tax asset, net of
existing valuation allowance, at 30 September 2010.  Major differences between the United States federal
statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate are:

   The Company does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures as long as those earnings are permanently reinvested in the companies that
produced them. These cumulative undistributed earnings are included in retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets and amounted to $3,442.6 at the end of 2010. An estimated $824.0 in U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes would be due if
these earnings were remitted as dividends after payment of all deferred taxes.  At 30 September 2010 and 2009,
the Company had $233.7 and $194.9 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $137.5 and $101.6, respectively, would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as a component of
income tax expense and totaled $5.5 in 2010, $2.5 in 2009, and $3.1 in 2008. The Company’s balance of unrecognized tax benefits included an accrual for interest and penalties of $36.0 and $31.8 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
The Company believes that it is possible that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service may complete its audit of the tax years 2007 and
2008 within the next twelve months. The Company is currently under examination in a number of other tax jurisdictions, some of which may be resolved in the next twelve months. As a result, it is reasonably possible that a change in the unrecognized
tax benefits may occur during the next twelve months. However, quantification of an estimated range cannot be made at this time. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

   Loss from Property Damage  In fiscal 2008, a fire at the
Company’s Ulsan, Korea nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) production facility
required the plant to be temporarily shut down. Other income (expense) for fiscal 2008 included a net loss of $14.7 ($10.7 after-tax, or $.05 per share) related to property damage. The net book value of the damaged property was written off and a
receivable was recorded for expected property damage insurance recoveries. In fiscal 2009, the Company received $3.7 of insurance recoveries representing interim payments on the claim. Additionally, the Company recorded other income of $4.9 ($3.1
after-tax, or $.01 per share), comprising $2.3 for the receipt of additional proceeds from a business interruption claim and a $2.6 adjustment to the book value of the damaged property. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company received $4.1 ($2.6
after-tax, or $.01 per share) of additional insurance proceeds in final settlement of its claim. The production facility resumed operations in April 2010.  Customer Bankruptcy and Asset Actions  On 6 January 2009 a customer of the
Company, who principally receives product from the Tonnage Gases segment, began operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result, the Company recognized a $22.2 ($13.9 after-tax, or $.07 per share) charge, primarily for the write-off of
certain receivables during the third quarter of 2009. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment’s results. 
In April 2010, the customer emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. The Company received a final settlement in the amount of $22.4, of
which $16.0 was applied against the remaining outstanding receivables. Income of $6.4 ($4.0 after-tax, or $.02 per share) was recognized for the recovery of certain receivables which had been previously written off. This amount was recorded as a
gain and is reflected within customer bankruptcy on the consolidated income statement.  In the third quarter of 2009, the
Company recorded a charge of $9.9 ($7.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) for other asset actions which consisted of the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. This charge was reflected in cost of sales on the consolidated income statement.

25.  Business Segment and Geographic Information
 The Company’s segments are organized based on differences in product and/or type of customer. The Company has
four business segments consisting of Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy.  Merchant Gases  The Merchant Gases segment sells atmospheric gases such as
oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air); process gases such as hydrogen and helium (purchased or refined from crude helium); and medical and specialty gases, along with certain services and equipment,
throughout the world to customers in many industries, including those in metals, glass, chemical processing, food processing, healthcare, steel, general manufacturing, and petroleum and natural gas industries. There are four principal types of
products: liquid bulk, packaged gases, small on-site plants, and healthcare products. Most merchant product is delivered via bulk supply, in liquid or gaseous form, by tanker or tube trailer. Smaller quantities of industrial, specialty, and medical
gases are delivered in cylinders and dewars as “packaged gases,” or through small on-sites (cryogenic or noncryogenic generators). Through its healthcare business, the Company offers respiratory therapies, home medical equipment, and
infusion services, primarily in Europe. Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. Natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the Company’s Merchant Gases facilities. The Company mitigates energy
and natural gas prices through pricing formulas and surcharges. Merchant Gases competes worldwide against global industrial gas companies and several regional sellers. Competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price, reliability of
supply, and the development of industrial gas applications. Competition in the healthcare business involves price, quality, service, and reliability of supply.  Tonnage Gases  Tonnage Gases provides hydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen,
oxygen, and syngas principally to the energy production and refining, chemical, and metallurgical industries worldwide. The Tonnage Gases segment also includes the Company’s Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI) business. The PUI business markets
toluene diamine to customers under long-term contracts. For large-volume, or “tonnage” industrial gas users, the Company either constructs a gas plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility—hence the term
“on-site”—or delivers product through a pipeline from a nearby location. The Company is the world’s largest provider of hydrogen, which is used by refiners to lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels to reduce smog
and ozone depletion. Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases, and natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas production. The Company mitigates energy and natural gas
price changes through its long-term cost pass-through type contracts. Tonnage Gases competes against global industrial gas companies, as well as regional competitors. Competition is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, the development of
applications that use industrial gases and, in some cases, provision of other services or products such as power and steam generation. The Company also derives a competitive advantage from its pipeline networks which enable it to provide reliable
and economic supply of products to customers.  Electronics and Performance Materials 
The Electronics and Performance Materials segment employs applications technology to provide solutions to a broad range of global
industries through expertise in chemical synthesis, analytical technology, process engineering, and surface science. This segment provides specialty and tonnage gases, specialty chemicals, services, and equipment to the electronics industry for the
manufacture of silicon and compound semiconductors, LCD and other displays, and photovoltaic devices. The segment also provides performance chemical solutions for the coatings, inks, adhesives, civil engineering, personal care, institutional and
industrial cleaning, mining, oil field, polyurethane, and other industries. The Electronics and Performance Materials segment faces competition on a product-by-product basis against competitors ranging from niche suppliers with a single product to
larger and more vertically integrated companies. Competition is principally conducted on the basis of price, quality, product performance, reliability of product supply, technical innovation, service, and global infrastructure. 
Equipment and Energy  The Equipment and Energy segment designs and manufactures cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas liquefaction (LNG), and helium distribution,
and serves energy markets in a variety of ways. Equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries, including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing.
Energy markets are served through the Company’s operation and partial ownership of cogeneration and flue gas desulfurization facilities, its development of hydrogen as an energy carrier, and oxygen-based technologies to

serve energy markets in the future. Equipment and Energy competes with a great number of firms for all of its offerings except LNG heat exchangers, for which there are fewer competitors due to
the limited market size and proprietary technologies. Competition is based primarily on technological performance, service, technical know-how, price, and performance guarantees. 
Other  Other operating income (loss) includes other expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income, and costs previously
allocated to businesses now reported as discontinued operations. Also included are LIFO inventory adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO and the LIFO pool adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate general and
administrative costs and research and development costs are fully allocated to the business segments.  Other assets
include cash, restricted cash, deferred tax assets, pension assets, financial instruments, and corporate assets previously allocated to businesses now reported as discontinued operations. 
Customers  The Company has a large number of customers, and no single customer accounts for a significant portion of annual sales.  Accounting Policies  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as
those described in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates the performance of segments based upon reported segment operating income. Operating income of the business segments includes general corporate expenses. Intersegment sales
are not material and are recorded at selling prices that approximate market prices. Equipment manufactured for the Company’s industrial gas business is generally transferred at cost and not reflected as an intersegment sale. Long-lived assets
include investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates, net plant and equipment, goodwill, and net intangible assets.  Business Segments  Business segment information is shown below:
