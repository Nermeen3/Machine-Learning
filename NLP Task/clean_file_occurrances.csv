Competition in the healthcare business involves price, quality, service, and reliability of supply. In Europe, primary healthcare competitors include the same three global industrial gas
automobiles. Most of the Company’s TDA is sold under long-term contracts with raw material cost and currency pass-through to a small number of customers. The Company employs proprietary technology and scale of production to differentiate its
polyurethane intermediates from those of its competitors.  Natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen, carbon
companies: L’Air Liquide S.A.; Linde AG; Praxair, Inc.; and several regional competitors. Competition is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, the development of applications that use industrial gases, and, in some cases, provision
situations exist in the European and Asian industrial gas markets where the Company competes against the three global companies as well as regional competitors. Global competitors for the PUI business are primarily BASF Corporation and Bayer AG.
